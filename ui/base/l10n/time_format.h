  // Return a localized string of more precise time duration, either formatted
  // as a single value or as two values: for a time delta of e.g. 2h19m either
  // "2 hours" or "2 hours and 19 minutes" could be returned in English.
  // Two-value output can be forced by setting |cutoff| to -1.  Single-value
  // output can be forced by using Simple() or setting |cutoff| to 0.
  // Otherwise, choice of format happens automatically and the value of |cutoff|
  // determines the largest numeric value that may appear in a single-value
  // format -- for lower numeric values, a second unit is added to increase
  // precision.  (Applied to the examples above, a |cutoff| of 2 or smaller
  // would yield the first string and a |cutoff| of 3 or larger would return the
  // second string.)
  //
  // The aim of this logic is to reduce rounding errors (that in single-value
  // representation can amount up to 33% of the true time duration) while at the
  // same time avoiding over-precise time outputs such as e.g. "56 minutes 29
  // seconds".  The relative rounding error is guaranteed to be less than 0.5 /
  // |cutoff| (e.g. 5% for a |cutoff| of 10) and a second unit is only used when
  // necessary to achieve the precision guarantee.
  //
  // If |use_month_and_year| is true, also display longer time in number of
  // month and year. A year is defined as 365 days. A month is defined as a
  // twelfth of the year. Due to the length of these time, and the approximate
  // definition, no cutoff is allowed with these values and showing two values
  // is not supported (1 month 2 days is ambiguous due to the definition of a
  // month).
  //
  // Currently, the only combination of format and length that is implemented is
  // (FORMAT_DURATION, LENGTH_LONG), but it's easy to add others if required.
  //
  // Note: To allow pre-, post- and infixes which can be inflected depending on
  // either the first or the second value, two separate translation strings
  // (IDS_TIME_*_1ST and IDS_TIME_*_2ND) are used per [plurality] times [pair of
  // units] and are concatenated after having been formatted individually.  The
  // separator between first unit and second unit (a blank in English) is
  // included in IDS_TIME_*_1ST.
