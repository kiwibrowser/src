// FocusManager handles focus traversal, stores and restores focused views, and
// handles keyboard accelerators. This class is an implementation detail of
// views::. Most callers should use methods of views:: classes rather than using
// FocusManager directly.
//
// There are 2 types of focus:
//
// - The native focus, which is the focus that a gfx::NativeView has.
// - The view focus, which is the focus that a views::View has.
//
// When registering a view with the FocusManager, the caller can provide a view
// whose focus will be kept in sync with the view the FocusManager is managing.
//
// (Focus registration is already done for you if you subclass the NativeControl
// class or if you use the NativeViewHost class.)
//
// When a top window (derived from views::Widget) that is not a child window is
// created, it creates and owns a FocusManager to manage the focus for itself
// and all its child windows.
//
// To be able to be focus-traversed when the Tab key is pressed, a class should
// implement the FocusTraversable interface. RootViews implement
// FocusTraversable. The FocusManager contains a top FocusTraversable instance,
// which is the top RootView.
//
// If you just use Views, then the RootView handles focus traversal for you. The
// default traversal order is the order in which the views have been added to
// their container. You can call View::SetNextFocusableView to modify this
// order.
//
// If you are embedding a native view containing a nested RootView (for example
// by adding a NativeControl that contains a NativeWidgetWin as its native
// component), then you need to:
//
// - Override the View::GetFocusTraversable method in your outer component.
//   It should return the RootView of the inner component. This is used when
//   the focus traversal traverse down the focus hierarchy to enter the nested
//   RootView. In the example mentioned above, the NativeControl overrides
//   GetFocusTraversable and returns hwnd_view_container_->GetRootView().
//
// - Call Widget::SetFocusTraversableParent on the nested RootView and point
//   it to the outer RootView. This is used when the focus goes out of the
//   nested RootView. In the example:
//
//     hwnd_view_container_->GetWidget()->SetFocusTraversableParent(
//         native_control->GetRootView());
//
// - Call RootView::SetFocusTraversableParentView on the nested RootView with
//   the parent view that directly contains the native window. This is needed
//   when traversing up from the nested RootView to know which view to start
//   with when going to the next/previous view. In the example:
//
//     hwnd_view_container_->GetWidget()->SetFocusTraversableParent(
//         native_control);
//
// Note that FocusTraversable views do not have to be RootViews:
// AccessibleToolbarView is FocusTraversable.
