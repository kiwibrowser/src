  // Constructor.
  // - |root| is the root of the view hierarchy to traverse. Focus will be
  //   trapped inside.
  // - |cycle| should be true if you want FindNextFocusableView to cycle back
  //           to the first view within this root when the traversal reaches
  //           the end. If this is true, then if you pass a valid starting
  //           view to FindNextFocusableView you will always get a valid view
  //           out, even if it's the same view.
  // - |accessibility_mode| should be true if full keyboard accessibility is
  //   needed and you want to check IsAccessibilityFocusable(), rather than
  //   IsFocusable().

  // Finds the next view that should be focused and returns it. If a
  // FocusTraversable is found while searching for the focusable view,
  // returns NULL and sets |focus_traversable| to the FocusTraversable
  // and |focus_traversable_view| to the view associated with the
  // FocusTraversable.
  //
  // Return NULL if the end of the focus loop is reached, unless this object
  // was initialized with |cycle|=true, in which case it goes back to the
  // beginning when it reaches the end of the traversal.
  // - |starting_view| is the view that should be used as the starting point
  //   when looking for the previous/next view. It may be NULL (in which case
  //   the first/last view should be used depending if normal/reverse).
  // - |search_direction| whether we should find the next (kForwards) or
  //   previous (kReverse) view.
  // - |traversal_direction| specifies whether we are traversing down (meaning
  //   we should look into child views) or traversing up (don't look at
  //   child views).
  // - |check_starting_view| indicated if starting_view may obtain the next
  //   focus.
  // - |can_go_into_anchored_dialog| controls if focus is allowed to jump
  //   into a dialog anchored at one of the views being traversed.
  // - |focus_traversable| is set to the focus traversable that should be
  //   traversed if one is found (in which case the call returns NULL).
  // - |focus_traversable_view| is set to the view associated with the
  //   FocusTraversable set in the previous parameter (it is used as the
  //   starting view when looking for the next focusable view).
