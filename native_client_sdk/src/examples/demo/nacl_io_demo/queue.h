/* This file implements a single-producer/single-consumer queue, using a mutex
 * and a condition variable.
 *
 * There are techniques to implement a queue like this without using memory
 * barriers or locks on x86, but ARM's memory system is different from x86, so
 * we cannot make the same assumptions about visibility order of writes. Using a
 * mutex is slower, but also simpler.
 *
 * We make the assumption that messages are only enqueued on the main thread
 * and consumed on the worker thread. Because we don't want to block the main
 * thread, EnqueueMessage will return zero if the message could not be enqueued.
 *
 * DequeueMessage will block until a message is available using a condition
 * variable. Again, this may not be as fast as spin-waiting, but will consume
 * much less CPU (and battery), which is important to consider for ChromeOS
 * devices. */
