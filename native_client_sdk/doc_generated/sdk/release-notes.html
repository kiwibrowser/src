<h1 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h1>
<p>The dates in the following release notes denote when Chrome and the NaCl SDK
reached canary status. The stable release is typically 6 weeks later.</p>
<h2 id="chrome-pepper-49">Chrome/Pepper 49</h2>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>GCC-based newlib toolchains removed from the SDK.  These have been
superseded by the nacl-clang toolchain which also produces statically linked
architecture specific nexe files.</li>
<li>gtest/gmock no longer shipped as pre-built libraries.  This is in-line with
normal gtest/gmock usage guidelines.  Projects wishing to use gtest/gmock must
now add explicit include paths and compile gtest-all.cc locally.</li>

<h3 id="pnacl">PNaCl</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The C11/C++11 <code>acquire</code>, <code>release</code>, and <code>acq_rel</code> memory orders are now
generated by default. The in-browser Chrome 42 translator supports them, the
SDK can therefore generate them.</li>
<li>Fix a <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=460432">code generation bug on ARM</a> when dealing with 16-bit load/store and
<code>bswap</code> which led to a NaCl validation failure.</li>
<li>PNaCl is now based on LLVM 3.6. If you are using GDB to debug PNaCl
<a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/devcycle/debugging.html#debugging-pnacl-pexes"><em>BC files with debug metadata in the browser</em></a>,
remember that debug info from SDK version <code>X</code> is only compatible with the
PNaCl translator in chrome version <code>X</code>. The bitcode debug metadata format
changed from LLVM 3.5 to 3.6. If you need to debug an app built with SDK
version <code>X</code> running in Chrome version <code>Y</code> (with <code>X != Y</code>), it is still
possible to do so. Simply translate the pexe to a nexe using the
<a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/devcycle/debugging.html#debugging-pexes-via-nexes"><em>offline pnacl-translate tool from SDK version X</em></a> instead of using the translator in the
browser (version <code>Y</code>).</li>
<li>PNaCl&#8217;s support for use of libstdc++ 4.6 as the C++ standard library is
deprecated and will be removed in the next release. PNaCl has used libc++
(which is much more up to date, currently based on LLVM 3.6) as the default
since Pepper 33.</li>
<li>PNaCl&#8217;s experimental <a class="reference external" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/+/master/README.rst">Subzero translator</a> is available for x86-32 NaCl in
Chrome version 43, behind a flag. To give it a try, run Chrome with the
<code>--enable-pnacl-subzero</code> commandline flag, and use the <code>optlevel 0</code>
<a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/reference/nacl-manifest-format.html#pnacl-nmf-optlevels"><em>NaCl manifest option</em></a>. Application startup time
should be several times faster than the previous LLVM-based <code>optlevel 0</code>
mode, with similar code quality. Note that x86-32 NaCl requires a 32-bit
Chrome. On Windows, it also requires a 32-bit Windows OS, but 64-bit Linux
OSes can run x86-32 NaCl. If you try it out, please send us feedback
on <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/native-client-dev">native-client-dev</a>. We are working on improvements and adding

<h3 id="sdk">SDK</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The SDK now contains experimental versions of <code>i686-nacl-clang</code>,
<code>x86_64-nacl-clang</code>, and <code>arm-nacl-clang</code> as well as the <code>clang++</code>
equivalents. These toolchains are based on the same LLVM version as PNaCl, but

<h3 id="id2">PNaCl</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>PNaCl supports C11/C++11 memory orders <code>acquire</code>, <code>release</code>, and
<code>acq_rel</code>. It used to upgrade all accesses to <code>seq_cst</code>. It still upgrades
<code>consume</code> to <code>acquire</code> (no compiler currently implements <code>consume</code>), and
<code>relaxed</code> to <code>seq_cst</code> (to conservatively avoid platform differences due
to out-of-thin-air problems). This is currently disabled by default in the SDK
so that the in-browser translator installed on users&#8217; machines has time to
gain this support. Developers can turn it on by passing the
<code>-pnacl-memory-order-seq-cst-only=false</code> flag to <code>opt</code>.</li>
<li>PNaCl handles nested struct type expansion, which allows it to better support
non-C languages such as Rust.</li>
<li>PNaCl breaks up many integer operations over 64-bits into individual 64-bit
operations. This is often encountered when using large consecutive bitfields.</li>

<h2 id="pepper-27-12-april-2013">Pepper 27 (12 April 2013)</h2>
<p>The Pepper 27 bundle features a significant number of new libraries that have
been incorporated directly into the SDK.</p>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">A number of libraries from the naclports project have been incorporated
directly into the Native Client SDK. These libraries include:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>image encoding/decoding: jpeg, tiff, png, webp</li>
<li>multimedia: openal, freealut, ogg, vorbis</li>
<li>XML parsing: tinyxml, xml2</li>
<li>miscellaneous: zlib (general purpose compression), freetype (font
rendering), lua (Lua interpreter)</li>
</ul>
<p>The libraries are located in <code>ports/lib</code>, and the header files are in
<code>ports/include</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>The <code>httpfs</code> filesystem in the nacl_io library now caches content in memory
by default; this improves performance considerably.</li>
<li>For applications compiled with a glibc toolchain, <code>dlopen()</code> can now be
used to open shared libraries that are not specified in an application&#8217;s
Native Client manifest (.nmf) file. This allows applications, for example, to
download a shared object and then use <code>dlopen()</code> to access the shared
object.  The <code>dlopen</code> example has been modified to demonstrate this
functionality: reverse.cc is built into a shared object (.so) file, which is
downloaded and opened using an <code>httpfs</code> mount.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Each example now has a single <code>index.html</code> file, instead of multiple HTML
files corresponding to NaCl modules built using different toolchains and
configurations. By default, most examples are built using one toolchain
(newlib) and one configuration (Debug). If you build an example using
multiple toolchains or configurations, you can specify which version to run
in Chrome using the query parameters <code>tc</code> and <code>config</code>. For example,
assuming you are serving an example from the local server localhost:5103, you
can run a version of the example built with the glibc toolchain in the
Release configuration by specifying the following URL in Chrome:
<code>http://localhost:5103/index.html?tc=glibc&amp;config=Release</code>. For additional
information about how different NaCl modules are loaded into <code>index.html</code>,
see the <code>common.js</code> file in each example.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-tools-and-toolchains">Build tools and toolchains</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Common makefiles, including <code>tools/common.mk</code>, can now handle source files
located outside of an application&#8217;s root directory. For example, a Makefile
for an application can specify a source file to compile such as
<code>../../some/other/place.cpp</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pepper-26-29-march-2013">Pepper 26 (29 March 2013)</h2>
<p>The Pepper 26 bundle includes a new HTTP filesystem type in the nacl_mounts
library (which has been renamed nacl_io), changes to the example Makefiles, a
simple new 3D example, and a threaded file IO example.</p>
<h3 id="id16">Build tools and toolchains</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">Makefiles have been changed significantly:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Build commands are now specified in a number of common files
(<code>tools/*.mk</code>), which are included in the Makefiles in the examples.</li>
<li>By default, make displays a simplified list of build steps (e.g., <code>CC
newlib/Debug/hello_world_x86_32.o</code>) rather than the actual build commands.
To see the actual build commands, run <code>make V=1</code>.</li>
<li>By default, most examples are built using one toolchain (newlib) and one
configuration (Debug). To build an example using a different toolchain or
configuration, run <code>make</code> with the parameters <code>TOOLCHAIN=&lt;x&gt;</code> or
<code>CONFIG=&lt;y&gt;</code>.  You can also run make <code>all_versions</code> to build an example
with all toolchains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Header files have been moved out of the toolchains. All toolchains now share
the same set of header files as host builds. Previously host and NaCl builds
used different headers, which could cause build problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id17">Libraries</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The nacl_mounts library has been renamed <strong>nacl_io</strong>, and has been expanded
with a new type of mount, httpfs, which can be used to read URLs via HTTP.

<h2 id="pepper-25-21-december-2012">Pepper 25 (21 December 2012)</h2>
<p>The Pepper 25 bundle features an ARM toolchain to build Native Client modules
for ARM devices, two new Pepper APIs (including the MessageLoop API, which lets
you make Pepper calls on background threads), two new libraries (nacl_mounts,
which provides a virtual file system that you can use with standard C file
operations, and ppapi_main, which lets you implement a Native Client module
using a simple ppapi_main function), and two new examples that demonstrate how
to use the nacl_mounts and ppapi_main libraries.</p>
<h3 id="id19">Build tools and toolchains</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">The SDK includes a new toolchain to build Native Client executables (.nexe
files) for <strong>ARM devices</strong>.</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Currently the ARM toolchain can only be used to compile modules that use
the <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/devcycle/dynamic-loading.html#c-libraries"><em>newlib C library</em></a>. You cannot use the ARM toolchain
to compile modules that use the glibc library.</li>
<li>The ARM toolchain is in the directory
<code>pepper_25/toolchain/&lt;host&gt;_arm_newlib</code>.  The bin subdirectory contains
the compiler (<code>arm-nacl-gcc</code>), the linker (<code>arm-nacl-g++</code>), and the
other tools in the toolchain.</li>
<li>Take a look at the <code>hello_world</code> example to see how to use the ARM
toolchain. Go to <code>examples/hello_world</code> and run <code>make</code>. When the build
finishes, the newlib/Debug and newlib/Release subdirectories will contain
.nexe files for the x86-32, x86-64, and ARM target architecutes, and a
Native Client manifest (.nmf file) that references those three .nexe files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The simple web server included in the SDK, <code>httpd.py</code>, has been moved from
the <code>examples/</code> directory to the <code>tools/</code> directory. On Windows, you can
run <code>httpd.cmd</code> (in the <code>examples/</code> directory) to start the server.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ppapi">PPAPI</h3>
<p>Pepper 25 includes two new APIs:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/native-client/pepper_stable/c/struct_p_p_b___console__1__0">Console API</a> lets your
module log messages to the JavaScript console in the Chrome browser.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/native-client/pepper_stable/cpp/classpp_1_1_message_loop">MessageLoop</a> API lets your
module make PPAPI calls on a background thread.  Once you&#8217;ve created a
message loop resource, attached it to a thread, and run it, you can post work
to the thread, including completion callbacks for asynchronous operations.
For a C++ example of how to use the MessageLoop API, see
<code>pepper_25/include/ppapi/utility/threading/simple_thread.h</code>. Note that you
cannot make asynchronous PPAPI calls on a background thread without creating
and using a message loop.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id20">Libraries</h3>
<p>The SDK includes two new libraries:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">The <strong>nacl_mounts</strong> library provides a virtual file system that your module
can &#8220;mount&#8221; in a given directory tree. The file system can be one of several
types:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>&#8220;memfs&#8221; is an in-memory file system,</li>
<li>&#8220;dev&#8221; is a file system with various utility nodes (e.g., <code>/dev/null</code>,
<code>/dev/console[0-3]</code>, <code>/dev/tty</code>), and</li>
<li>&#8220;html5fs&#8221; is a persistent file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve mounted a file system in your module, you can use standard C
library file operations: fopen, fread, fwrite, fseek, and fclose. How those
operations are performed depends on the type of file system (e.g., for
html5fs, the operations are performed using the Pepper FileIO API). For a
list of the types of file systems you can mount, see
include/nacl_mounts/nacl_mounts.h. For an example of how to use nacl_mounts,
see examples/hello_nacl_mounts. Note that html5fs is subject to the same
constraints as persistent <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/coding/file-io.html#devguide-coding-fileio"><em>local file IO</em></a> in
Chrome (for example, prior to using an html5fs file system, you must <a class="reference external" href="enabling_file_access">enable
local file IO</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>The <strong>ppapi_main</strong> library simplifies the creation of a NaCl module by
providing a familiar C programming environment. With this library, your
module can have a simple entry point called ppapi_main(), which is similar to
the standard C main() function, complete with argc and argv[] parameters.
Your module can also use standard C functions such as printf(), fopen(), and
fwrite(). For details see include/ppapi_main/ppapi_main.h. For an example of
how to use ppapi_main, see examples/hello_world_stdio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Header files for the new libraries are in the <code>include/</code> directory, source
files are in the <code>src/</code> directory, and compiled libraries are in the <code>lib/</code>
directory.</p>

<h2 id="pepper-24-5-december-2012">Pepper 24 (5 December 2012)</h2>
<p>The Pepper 24 bundle features a new, experimental toolchain called PNaCl (short
for &#8220;Portable Native Client&#8221;), a new library (pthreads-win32) for the Windows
SDK, and an expanded list of attributes for Pepper 3D contexts that lets
applications specify a GPU preference for low power or performance.</p>
<h3 id="id22">Build tools and toolchains</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The SDK includes a new, experimental toolchain called <a class="reference external" href="http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/data/site/pnacl.pdf">PNaCl</a> (pronounced
&#8220;pinnacle&#8221;). The PNaCl toolchain produces architecture-independent executable
files (.pexe files). Chrome doesn&#8217;t yet support .pexe files directly, but if
you want to experiment with this early preview of PNaCl, the toolchain
includes a tool to translate .pexe files into architecture-specific .nexe
files. Take a look at the <code>hello_world</code> example to see how to build a .pexe
file and translate it into multiple .nexe files. Note that PNaCl is currently
restricted to the newlib C standard library – if your application uses glibc,
you can&#8217;t build it with PNaCl.</li>
<li>The <code>create_nmf.py</code> script uses ELF headers (rather than file names) to
determine the architecture of .nexe files. That means you can change the
names of your .nexe files and <code>create_nmf.py</code> will still be able to
generate the appropriate Native Client manifest file for your application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id24">Examples</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The SDK examples now build with four toolchains: the glibc and newlib
toolchains, the experimental PNaCl toolchain, and the hosted toolchain on
your development machine. Within each toolchain build, each example also
builds both a debug and a release version.</li>
<li>The example Makefiles use dependency (.d) files to enable incremental builds.</li>
<li>The pong example has been cleaned up and modified to run more smoothly. The
drawing function is now set up as the Flush() callback, which allows 2D
drawing to occur as quickly as possible.</li>

the GPU. Contexts with a low power preference may be created on an integrated

<li>Each example in the SDK now builds both a debug and a release version. As
before, most examples also build newlib and glibc versions, which means that

the examples to see the compiler flags that are used for debug and release
versions. For a description of those flags, see <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/devcycle/building.html#compile-flags"><em>Compile flags for

<li>Comments have been added to common.js, which is used in all the examples. The
JavaScript in common.js inserts an &lt;embed&gt; element that loads the NaCl module
in each example&#8217;s web page, attaches event listeners to monitor the loading
of the module, and implements handleMessage() to respond to messages sent
from the NaCl module to the JavaScript side of the application</li>
