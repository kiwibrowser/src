// Device capabilities are a set of features used to determine what operations
// are available on the device. They are identified by a key (string) and a
// value (base::Value). The class serves 2 main purposes:
//
// 1) Provide an interface for updating default capabilities and querying their
// current value. Default capabilities are known to the system beforehand
// and used by modules throughout Chromecast to control behavior of operations.
//
// 2) Store dynamic capabilities. Dynamic capabilities are not known to the
// system beforehand and are introduced by external parties. These capabilites
// are stored and then forwarded to app servers that use them to determine how
// to interact with the device.
//
// Capabilities can be classified as either "public" or "private". Capabilities
// of both types can be used by the Chromecast platform to control internal
// behaviors, but only public capabilities will be advertised to app servers.
// Once a capability is set, it retains its privacy classification permanently;
// attempting to change the privacy of a capability results in an error.
// Private capabilities can only be added by Validators. Calling SetCapability()
// on a path without a Validator will default to setting the capability as
// public.
//
// Thread Safety:
// Observers can be added from any thread. Each Observer is guaranteed to be
// notified on same thread that it was added on and must be removed on the same
// thread that it was added on.
//
// Validators can be registered from any thread. Each Validator's Validate()
// method is guaranteed to be called on same thread that the Validator was
// registered on. The Validator must be unregistered on the same thread
// that it was registered on.
//
// All other methods can be called safely from any thread.

// TODO(esum):
// 1) Add WifiSupported, HotspotSupported, and MultizoneSupported capabilities.
// 2) It's not ideal to have the accessors (BluetoothSupported(), etc.) not
//    be valid initially until the capability gets registered. We might want
//    to use some kind of builder class to solve this.
