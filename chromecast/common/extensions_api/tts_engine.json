If your extension registers using this API, it will receive events containing an utterance to be spoken and other parameters when any extension or Chrome App uses the <a href='tts'>tts</a> API to generate speech. Your extension can then use any available web technology to synthesize and output the speech, and send events back to the calling function to report the status.",
