  This function navigates the tab into Facebook's login page and logs in a user
  using credentials in |credential| part of the |credentials_path| file.

  Args:
    action_runner: Action runner responsible for running actions on the page.
    credential: The credential to retrieve from the credentials file
        (type string). It's recommended to use 'facebooktest' account since
        it's a test account and will not trigger credential verification.
        However, the limitation is the test account cannot access actual
        facebook's pages & people (more restrictions in
        https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/test-users#rules)
    credentials_path: The string that specifies the path to credential file.

  Raises:
    exceptions.Error: See ExecuteJavaScript()
    for a detailed list of possible exceptions.
