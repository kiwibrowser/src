This file is a comprehensive list of Chrome user actions along with the owner
and description for each user action.

For best practices on writing user action descriptions, see
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/tools/metrics/actions/README.md
For details on how to modify this file to add your description, keep reading.

If an action is not user triggered, specify it using not_user_triggered="true"
as an attribute to the <action> tag.

Please run extract_actions.py to add new actions and pretty-print this file.

If a user action is not being used any more, put an <obsolete> tag under
the <action> tag with necessary explanation. Don't delete things in this file.

TODO(yiyaoliu):
Currently, only file-level comments are supported. By running
extract_actions.py, comments at other places will be deleted. Ideally, comments
should be able to be added at any place in this file.

<action name="MobileClipboardChanged">
  <owner>jif@chromium.org</owner>

  <description>
    Emitted when Chrome detects that the clipboard contains new content.

    On iOS: this occurs either when Chrome enters the foreground and notices
    that the content of the clipboard changed, or when the users selects the
    omnibox and Chrome notices that the content of the clipboard changed.

    On Android: this occurs when Chrome starts up or when the clipboard changes
    while Chrome is running (in the foreground or not).
  </description>
</action>

<action name="MobileComeToForeground">
  <owner>tedchoc@chromium.org</owner>
  <description>
    Chrome has come to the foreground.  Only emitted if the foreground content
    is an Activity that views web content, e.g., not settings.  This will be
    emitted everytime the Activity goes from entirely hidden to at least
    partially visible.  Partially visible means that at least some portion of
    the Activity is visible, but the Activity is not interactable, e.g. being
    covered by the share dialog, javascript alert dialogs, the voice input
    dialog, etc.

    Please note, this has the potential to be called many times for a given
    session.  For further details, see the Android activity concept of onPause
    and onResume for a better understanding of what circumstances can trigger
    this.

    Session tracking is based on the same visibility concept, but a session can
    span multiple live Android Activities, while this metric will be logged when
    each applicable Activity goes to the foreground (per above).  Since session
    tracking uses onPause and onResume, this metric is also tied to that to
    ensure we capture the event.

<action name="MobileGoToBackground">
  <owner>tedchoc@chromium.org</owner>
  <description>
    Chrome has gone to the background.  Only emitted if the previously
    foregrounded content was an Activity that views web content, e.g., not
    settings.  Chrome may be partially visible at this point, but is not
    directly in the foreground/interactable.  Partially visible means that at
    least some portion of the Activity is visible, but the Activity is not
    interactable, e.g. being covered by the share dialog, javascript alert
    dialogs, the voice input dialog, etc.

    Please note, this has the potential to be called many times for a given
    session.  For further details, see the Android activity concept of onPause
    and onResume for a better understanding of what circumstances can trigger
    this.

    Session tracking is based on the same visibility concept, but a session can
    span multiple live Android Activities, while this metric will be logged when
    each applicable Activity goes to the background (per above).  Since session
    tracking uses onPause and onResume, this metric is also tied to that to
    ensure we capture the event.

    for whether or not to offer to save a password.  At the time of writing,
    failure means that either the form submission was canceled with a failure
    message, or the form submission succeeded, but the user was directed back to
    a page that still contained a login form.
