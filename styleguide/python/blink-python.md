# Blink Python Style Guide

Blink follows [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) unless an
exception is listed below. See
[blink/tools/blinkpy/pylintrc](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/tools/blinkpy/pylintrc).

_Note: We likely want to converge with [Chromium style](python.md), so this
style recommendation is likely to change._
