Description:
  WebDriver is a clean, fast framework for automated testing of webapps.

Contents:
  pylib/
    Python bindings and tests for WebDriver pulled in via DEPS.

  atoms.h, atoms.cc
    These atoms are generated by the webdriver team and are to be checked in
    manually. The current version was generated from revision
    381f815652933f7077762ffba5f18794ab88c9b5.

    To generate the atoms using the code found in selenium tree:
      $ git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git
      $ cd selenium
      $ git apply <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/patch.diff
      $ ./go //javascript/chrome-driver:atoms
      $ cp build/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.h \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.h
      $ cp build/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.cc \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.cc

    The atoms.h/cc files are only used directly in the chrome version of
    webdriver found under the path src/chrome/test/chromedriver.

Local Modifications:
- Applied changes in patch.diff to the selenium tree prior to building the atoms.
