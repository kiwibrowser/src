  <description summary="Protocol for the stylus tools">
    This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to control the behavior
    of stylus tools.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

      The global interface is used to instantiate an interface extension for a
      wl_surface object. This extended interface will then allow the client to
      control the stylus-related behavior for input device event processing
      related to wl_surface.

      An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
      client to control the behavior of stylus tools.

      If the wl_surface associated with the stylus_tool object is destroyed,
      the stylus_tool object becomes inert.

      If the stylus_tool object is destroyed, the stylus_tool state is removed
      from the wl_surface. The change will be applied on the next
      wl_surface.commit.
