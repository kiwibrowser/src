  <interface name="zcr_gaming_input_v2" version="1">
    <description summary="extends wl_seat with gaming input devices">
      A global interface to provide gaming input devices for a given seat.

      Currently only gamepad devices are supported.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and uinterface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.
