  <description summary="Protocol for providing secure output">
    This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to prevent surface
    contents from appearing in screenshots or from being visible on non-secure
    outputs.

    In order to prevent surface contents from appearing in screenshots or from
    being visible on non-secure outputs, a client must first bind the global
    interface "wp_secure_output" which, if a compositor supports secure output,
    is exposed by the registry. Using the bound global object, the client uses
    the "get_security" request to instantiate an interface extension for a
    wl_surface object. This extended interface will then allow surfaces
    to be marked as only visible on secure outputs.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

      An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
      client to specify that a surface should not appear in screenshots
      or be visible on non-secure outputs.

      If the wl_surface associated with the security object is destroyed,
      the security object becomes inert.

      If the security object is destroyed, the security state is removed
      from the wl_surface. The change will be applied on the next
      wl_surface.commit.
