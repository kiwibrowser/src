  <description summary="Protocol for providing vertical synchronization timing">
    This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to inform the client about
    vertical synchronization timing in a precise way and without unnecessary
    overhead.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the version number in the protocol is removed and
    the interface version number is reset.

      <description summary="vsync timing updated">
        Notifies client that vertical synchronization timing of given wl_output
        has changed.

        Timing information consists of two data, timebase and interval. Timebase
        is an absolute timestamp of the vsync event that caused the timing to
        change. Interval is a period of time between subsequent vsync events.

        The unit of all above mentioned time values shall be microseconds and
        absolute timestamps should match the realm of the primary system
        monotonic counter, i.e. the POSIX clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC). Data
        type of both values is defined to be a 64-bit unsigned integer, but
        since the biggest unsigned integer datatype defined by the Wayland
        protocol is the 32-bit uint, both timebase and interval are split into
        most significant and least significant part, suffixed by "_h" and "_l"
        respectively.
