    remote_shell allows clients to turn a wl_surface into a "real window"

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

	bounds change. The client may apply the different move/resize
	strategy depending on the reason.

	"display_id_hi", "display_id_lo" specifies in which workspace

	The client responds with set_window_geometry request, with the

	requested).

	The client may ignore move request depending on the state,
	e.g, if it becomes resizable or other constrants.
