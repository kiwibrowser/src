  <interface name="zcr_stylus_v2" version="1">
    <description summary="extends wl_touch with events for on-screen stylus">
      Allows a wl_touch to report stylus specific information. The client can
      interpret the on-screen stylus like any other touch event, and use
      this protocol to obtain detail information about the type of stylus,
      as well as the force and tilt of the tool.

      These events are to be fired by the server within the same frame as other
      wl_touch events.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and uinterface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.
