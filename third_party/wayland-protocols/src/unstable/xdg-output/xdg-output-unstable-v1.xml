  <description summary="Protocol to describe output regions">
    This protocol aims at describing outputs in a way which is more in line
    with the concept of an output on desktop oriented systems.

    Some information are more specific to the concept of an output for
    a desktop oriented system and may not make sense in other applications,
    such as IVI systems for example.

    Typically, the global compositor space on a desktop system is made of
    a contiguous or overlapping set of rectangular regions.

    Some of the information provided in this protocol might be identical
    to their counterparts already available from wl_output, in which case
    the information provided by this protocol should be preferred to their
    equivalent in wl_output. The goal is to move the desktop specific
    concepts (such as output location within the global compositor space,
    the connector name and types, etc.) out of the core wl_output protocol.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible
    changes may be added together with the corresponding interface
    version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version
    number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the
    interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,
    the 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and
    interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

    <event name="logical_size">
      <description summary="size of the output in the global compositor space">
	The logical_size event describes the size of the output in the
	global compositor space.

	For example, a surface without any buffer scale, transformation
	nor rotation set, with the size matching the logical_size will
	have the same size as the corresponding output when displayed.

	Most regular Wayland clients should not pay attention to the
	logical size and would rather rely on xdg_shell interfaces.

	Some clients such as Xwayland, however, need this to configure
	their surfaces in the global compositor space as the compositor
	may apply a different scale from what is advertised by the output
	scaling property (to achieve fractional scaling, for example).

	For example, for a wl_output mode 3840×2160 and a scale factor 2:

	- A compositor not scaling the surface buffers will advertise a
	  logical size of 3840×2160,

	- A compositor automatically scaling the surface buffers will
	  advertise a logical size of 1920×1080,

	- A compositor using a fractional scale of 1.5 will advertise a
	  logical size to 2560×1620.

	The logical_size event is sent after creating an xdg_output
	(see xdg_output_manager.get_xdg_output) and whenever the logical
	size of the output changes, either as a result of a change in the
	applied scale or because of a change in the corresponding output
	mode(see wl_output.mode) or transform (see wl_output.transform).
