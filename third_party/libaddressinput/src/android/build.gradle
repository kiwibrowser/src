     * NOTE: Because the 'buildToolsVersion' directive only matches an exact
     * release (rather than allowing wildcards) and Android remove older
     * versions of the build tools very soon after a new revision is made
     * available, we must never use the lastest major version of the build
     * tools here (because it will quickly be superceded and become unavailable
     * to anyone using a fresh install of the SDK). The "final" release of the
     * previous major version remains available for much longer however, so as
     * a workaround we always use that.
     *
     * So when the build tools version 23.0.0 is released, the buildToolsVersion
     * below should be bumped to the last released version of the 22.x.x series.
     *
     * The obvious way to fix this would be allow wildcards (ie, "22.+") but
     * Android have explicitly said that they won't do this.
