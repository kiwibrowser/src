div#target, #shadow-root (open), div#div3_open, #shadow-root (closed),
div#div2_closed, #shadow-root (open), div#host_open, div#host_closed,
body, html, #document, window

On #host_closed, #host_open, and #div2_closed,
div#target, #shadow-root (open), div#div3_open, #shadow-root (closed)
will be trimmed (length=8).
