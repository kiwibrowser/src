Test that a deleteDatabase called while handling an upgradeneeded event is queued and fires its events at the right time. The close() call to unblock the delete occurs in the open request's 'success' event handler.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


dbname = "delete-in-upgradeneeded-close-in-open-success.html"
indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)

initiallyDeleted():
request = indexedDB.open(dbname, 1)

upgradeNeededCallback():
PASS sawUpgradeNeeded is false
sawUpgradeNeeded = true
PASS event.oldVersion is 0
PASS event.newVersion is 1
db = event.target.result
request2 = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)
request2.onsuccess = deleteSuccessCallback

openSuccess():
PASS sawUpgradeNeeded is true
PASS sawVersionChange is false
sawOpenSuccess = true
db = event.target.result
PASS db.version is 1

versionChangeCallback():
PASS event.oldVersion is 1
PASS event.newVersion is null
PASS sawOpenSuccess is true
sawVersionChange = true
Connection not closed at the end of 'versionchange', so 'blocked' should fire

deleteBlockedCallback():
PASS sawVersionChange is true
PASS sawOpenSuccess is true
sawDeleteBlocked = true
db.close()

deleteSuccessCallback():
PASS sawVersionChange is true
PASS sawDeleteBlocked is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
