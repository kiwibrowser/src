This test verifies that we don't crash in debug builds when using flex tracks and 'stretch' value for the content alignment css properties.

When the sum of all track's flex factor is < 1, they don't exhaust the available space, which is used to stretch the 'auto' sized tracks.

PASS
When the sum of all track's flex factor is >= 1, they exhaust the available space, hence the 'stretch' alignment is not applied to the 'auto' sized tracks.

PASS
