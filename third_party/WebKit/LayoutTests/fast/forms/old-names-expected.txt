This tests accessing form elements by name. IE only lets you look up names under the first name the element had and does not respond to name changes. Firefox remembers every name item has been accessed with, but forgets items that have not been accessed. This test has been written to expect the Firefox behavior.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

check that we no longer remember the past names of a

PASS form.thisWillBeForgotten is undefined
PASS form.thisWillBeForgottenToo is undefined

Ensures elements are removed from the past names map of a form element once they are no longer associated with the form element.
PASS form1['foo'] is input3
PASS form2.appendChild(form1.firstChild); form1['foo'] is undefined.
PASS form2['foo'] is input3
PASS form2.removeChild(input3); form2['foo'] is undefined.
PASS form1.appendChild(input3); form1['foo'] is input3
PASS input3.setAttribute('form', 'form1'); form1.removeChild(input3); input3.appendChild(form1); form1['foo'] is undefined.
PASS form1['foo'] is not input3

Don't add the element from the past names map if we've found elements of the given name.
PASS form4['foo'] is form4.childNodes[0]
PASS form4['bar'][0] is form4.childNodes[1]
PASS form4['bar'][1] is form4.childNodes[2]
PASS form4.childNodes[0].name = 'bar'; form4.childNodes[1].name = form4.childNodes[2].name = 'foo'; form4['foo'].length is 2
