This test checks that text controls with percentage heights within table cells have the correct height.Text controls are in a different test than other replaced elements because their metrics are platform-specific.The reason a 75% control is the same height as a 100% control is because a replaced element that depends on theheight of its parent cell is treated as auto. So by itself it will set the height of the row. See https://drafts.csswg.org/css-tables-3/#row-layout

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
