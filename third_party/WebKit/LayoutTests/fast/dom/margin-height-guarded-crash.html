<!--
Adapted from clusterfuzz case filed in https://crbug.com/778956.
This bug was a combination of 2 things:
  - calling appendChild with an iframe's body as the child causes the
    iframe body to become null
  - changing a body's margin height in an event handler reacting a
    change in the same body's margin width causes a method call on the
    body without checking if it's null. The change in height does not
    complete immediately, some of the change is applied to the Node
    _after_ the handler completes by which point the node (body) has
    become null.
-->
<iframe id=html_iframe></iframe>
<div id=html_div></div>
<script>
function reactToWidthChange() {
  // null the body
  html_div.appendChild(html_iframe.contentDocument.body);
  // change the height
  html_iframe.marginHeight = "0";
}

test(() => {
  window[0].addEventListener("DOMSubtreeModified", reactToWidthChange);
  html_iframe.marginWidth = "0";
}, 'try-trigger-crash');
</script>
</body>
