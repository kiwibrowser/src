Test what happens when you set the window's prototype to various values.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS __proto__ = window; __proto__ threw exception TypeError: Immutable prototype object '#<Window>' cannot have their prototype set.
PASS __proto__ = chainPointingBackToWindow; __proto__ threw exception TypeError: Immutable prototype object '#<Window>' cannot have their prototype set.
PASS __proto__ = 1; __proto__ is originalWindowPrototype
PASS __proto__ = 'a string'; __proto__ is originalWindowPrototype
PASS __proto__ = anotherObject; __proto__ threw exception TypeError: Immutable prototype object '#<Window>' cannot have their prototype set.
PASS anotherObject.__proto__ = window; __proto__ is originalWindowPrototype
