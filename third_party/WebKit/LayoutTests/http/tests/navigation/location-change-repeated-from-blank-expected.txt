This test checks the following case:
* Create an iframe
* Set its location to about:blank
* In a setTimeout(), navigate to a non-blank page
The iframe navigations should not create new history entries, even though the non-blank navigation is after the load (there is only one history entry in the iframe context, and it is about:blank).
