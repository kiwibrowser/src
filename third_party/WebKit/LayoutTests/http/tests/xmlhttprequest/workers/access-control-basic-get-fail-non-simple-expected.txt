CONSOLE ERROR: Failed to load http://localhost:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/access-control-basic-get-fail-non-simple.cgi: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
GET should not trigger a preflight request from a worker unless it has non-simple headers.
