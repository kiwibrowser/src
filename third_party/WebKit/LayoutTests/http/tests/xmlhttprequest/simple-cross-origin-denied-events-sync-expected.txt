CONSOLE WARNING: line 25: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
CONSOLE ERROR: line 26: Failed to load http://localhost:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/reply.xml: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
Test that a simple cross-origin request to a server that responds (but does not permit cross-origin requests) is indistinguishable from one that does not exist. Should say PASS:

PASS
