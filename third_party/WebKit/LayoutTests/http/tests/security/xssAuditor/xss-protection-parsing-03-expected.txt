The server sent an 'X-XSS-Protection' header requesting this behavior.
CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 31: PASS: "frame" is cross-origin.
This tests that the X-XSS-Protection header is not ignored when there is a trailing semicolon following mode=blank. Although theoretically malformed, we tolerate this case without issuing an error.

Frame: 'frame'

Could not load the requested resource.
