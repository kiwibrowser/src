CONSOLE ERROR: Access to CSS stylesheet at 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/resources/slow-script.pl?delay=100' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
