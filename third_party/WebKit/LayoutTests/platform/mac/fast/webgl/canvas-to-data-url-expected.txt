Check if back buffer (toDataURL) is equal to front buffer (getImageSourceURL) one frame after drawing webgl contents.
1) when drawingBuffer is preserved.
FAIL preserve_canvas3D.toDataURL('image/png') == internals.getImageSourceURL(preserve_canvas3D) should be true. Was false.
2) when drawingBuffer is not preserved. They must be different.
