This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL lh in line-height on root assert_approx_equals: the lh unit on the root element's line-height property uses font metrics corresponding to the initial values of the font or line-height properties expected 20 +/- 1 but got 166
FAIL rlh in line-height on root assert_approx_equals: the rlh unit on the root element's line-height property uses font metrics corresponding to the initial values of the font or line-height properties expected 20 +/- 1 but got 166
PASS lh in font-size on root
PASS rlh in font-size on root
FAIL 2lh in line-height on root assert_approx_equals: the lh unit on the root element's line-height property actually works as a unit and doesn't merely cause a fallback that doesn't take the number of units into account expected 40 +/- 1 but got 166
FAIL 2rlh in line-height on root assert_approx_equals: the rlh unit on the root element's line-height property actually works as a unit and doesn't merely cause a fallback that doesn't take the number of units into account expected 40 +/- 1 but got 166
FAIL 2lh in font-size on root assert_approx_equals: the lh unit on the root element's font-size property actually works as a unit and doesn't merely cause a fallback that doesn't take the number of units into account expected 32 +/- 1 but got 16
FAIL 2rlh in font-size on root assert_approx_equals: the rlh unit on the root element's font-size property actually works as a unit and doesn't merely cause a fallback that doesn't take the number of units into account expected 32 +/- 1 but got 16
Harness: the test ran to completion.
