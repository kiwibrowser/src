This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Magnetometer: Test that 'onreading' is called and sensor reading is valid
PASS Magnetometer: sensor reading is correct
PASS Magnetometer: sensor timestamp is updated when time passes
PASS Magnetometer: Test that sensor can be successfully created and its states are correct.
PASS Magnetometer: sensor.start() returns undefined
PASS Magnetometer: no exception is thrown when calling start() on already started sensor
PASS Magnetometer: sensor.stop() returns undefined
PASS Magnetometer: no exception is thrown when calling stop() on already stopped sensor
PASS Magnetometer: Test that fresh reading is fetched on start()
PASS Magnetometer: frequency hint works
PASS Magnetometer: sensor receives suspend / resume notifications when  cross-origin subframe is focused
FAIL Magnetometer: throw 'TypeError' if frequency is invalid assert_throws: when freq is undefined function "() => { new sensorType({frequency: freq}) }" did not throw
PASS Magnetometer: sensor reading is correct when options.referenceFrame is 'screen'
PASS Magnetometer: throw 'TypeError' if referenceFrame is not one of enumeration values
