This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setRemoteDescription() on offer with a=identity should establish peerIdentity pc1.setIdentityProvider is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription() on offer with a=identity that resolve to value different from target peer identity should reject with InvalidModificationError pc1.setIdentityProvider is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription() with peerIdentity set and with IdP proxy that return validationAssertion with mismatch contents should reject with OperationError pc1.setIdentityProvider is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription() and peerIdentity should reject with OperationError if IdP return validated identity that is different from its own domain pc1.setIdentityProvider is not a function
FAIL When IdP throws error and pc has target peer identity, setRemoteDescription() and peerIdentity rejected with RTCError('idp-execution-error') pc1.setIdentityProvider is not a function
FAIL IdP failure with no target peer identity should have following setRemoteDescription() succeed and replace pc.peerIdentity with a new promise pc1.setIdentityProvider is not a function
Harness: the test ran to completion.
