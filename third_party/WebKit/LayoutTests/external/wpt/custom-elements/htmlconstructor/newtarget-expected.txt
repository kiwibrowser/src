This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Use NewTarget's prototype, not the one stored at definition time
PASS Rethrow any exceptions thrown while getting the prototype
PASS If prototype is not object (null), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (autonomous custom elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (undefined), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (autonomous custom elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (5), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (autonomous custom elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (string), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (autonomous custom elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (null), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (customized built-in elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (undefined), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (customized built-in elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (5), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (customized built-in elements)
PASS If prototype is not object (string), derives the fallback from NewTarget's realm (customized built-in elements)
FAIL HTMLParagraphElement constructor must not get .prototype until it finishes its extends sanity checks, calling proxy constructor directly assert_equals: Should never have gotten .prototype expected 0 but got 1
FAIL HTMLParagraphElement constructor must not get .prototype until it finishes its extends sanity checks, calling via Reflect assert_equals: Should never have gotten .prototype expected 0 but got 1
Harness: the test ran to completion.
