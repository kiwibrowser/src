This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController should not be exported on the global object
PASS TransformStream.prototype.constructor should have standard properties
PASS TransformStream.prototype.constructor should be a constructor
PASS TransformStream.prototype.readable should have standard properties
PASS TransformStream.prototype.readable should be a getter
PASS TransformStream.prototype.writable should have standard properties
PASS TransformStream.prototype.writable should be a getter
PASS TransformStream.prototype should have exactly the expected properties
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.constructor should have standard properties
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.constructor should be a constructor
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.desiredSize should have standard properties
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.desiredSize should be a getter
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.enqueue should have standard properties
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.enqueue should be a method
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.error should have standard properties
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.error should be a method
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.terminate should have standard properties
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype.terminate should be a method
PASS TransformStreamDefaultController.prototype should have exactly the expected properties
PASS transformer method start should be called with the right number of arguments
PASS transformer method start should be called even when it's located on the prototype chain
FAIL unexpected properties should not be accessed when calling transformer method start assert_array_equals: expected properties should be got property 0, expected "writableType" but got "readableType"
PASS transformer method transform should be called with the right number of arguments
PASS transformer method transform should be called even when it's located on the prototype chain
FAIL unexpected properties should not be accessed when calling transformer method transform assert_array_equals: expected properties should be got property 0, expected "writableType" but got "readableType"
PASS transformer method flush should be called with the right number of arguments
PASS transformer method flush should be called even when it's located on the prototype chain
FAIL unexpected properties should not be accessed when calling transformer method flush assert_array_equals: expected properties should be got property 0, expected "writableType" but got "readableType"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
