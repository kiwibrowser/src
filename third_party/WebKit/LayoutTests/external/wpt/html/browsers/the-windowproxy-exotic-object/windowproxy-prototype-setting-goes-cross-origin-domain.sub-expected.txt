This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Same-origin (for now): the prototype is accessible
PASS Became cross-origin via document.domain: the prototype is now null
FAIL Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to an empty object via Object.setPrototypeOf should throw a TypeError assert_throws: function "() => {
      Object.setPrototypeOf(target, newValue);
    }" threw object "SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame." ("SecurityError") expected object "TypeError" ("TypeError")
PASS Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to an empty object via __proto__ should throw a "SecurityError" DOMException
FAIL Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to an empty object via Reflect.setPrototypeOf should return false Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
PASS Became cross-origin via document.domain: the prototype must still be null
FAIL Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to null via Object.setPrototypeOf should not throw Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
PASS Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to null via __proto__ should throw a "SecurityError" since it ends up in CrossOriginGetOwnProperty
FAIL Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to null via Reflect.setPrototypeOf should return true Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
FAIL Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to the original value from before going cross-origin via Object.setPrototypeOf should throw a TypeError assert_throws: function "() => {
      Object.setPrototypeOf(target, newValue);
    }" threw object "SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame." ("SecurityError") expected object "TypeError" ("TypeError")
PASS Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to the original value from before going cross-origin via __proto__ should throw a "SecurityError" DOMException
FAIL Became cross-origin via document.domain: setting the prototype to the original value from before going cross-origin via Reflect.setPrototypeOf should return false Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
