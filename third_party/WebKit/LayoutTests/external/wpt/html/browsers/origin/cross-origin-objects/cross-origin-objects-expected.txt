This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Basic sanity-checking
PASS Only whitelisted properties are accessible cross-origin
PASS [[GetPrototypeOf]] should return null
FAIL [[SetPrototypeOf]] should return false assert_throws: proto setter |call| on cross-origin Window function "function() { protoSetter.call(C, new Object()); }" threw object "SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame." ("SecurityError") expected object "TypeError" ("TypeError")
PASS [[IsExtensible]] should return true for cross-origin objects
FAIL [[PreventExtensions]] should throw for cross-origin objects assert_throws: preventExtensions on cross-origin Window should throw function "function() { Object.preventExtensions(C) }" threw object "SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame." ("SecurityError") expected object "TypeError" ("TypeError")
FAIL [[GetOwnProperty]] - Properties on cross-origin objects should be reported |own| Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
FAIL [[GetOwnProperty]] - Property descriptors for cross-origin properties should be set up correctly assert_equals: property descriptor for 0 should be enumerable expected true but got false
PASS [[GetOwnProperty]] - Subframe named 'then' should shadow the default 'then' value
PASS [[Delete]] Should throw on cross-origin objects
PASS [[DefineOwnProperty]] Should throw for cross-origin objects
FAIL Can only enumerate safelisted enumerable properties assert_equals: Enumerate all enumerable safelisted cross-origin Window properties expected 2 but got 0
FAIL [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should return all properties from cross-origin objects assert_array_equals: Object.getOwnPropertyNames() gives the right answer for cross-origin Window lengths differ, expected 16 got 13
FAIL [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should return the right symbol-named properties for cross-origin objects assert_array_equals: Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() should return the three symbol-named properties that are exposed on a cross-origin Window lengths differ, expected 3 got 0
FAIL [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should place the symbols after the property names after the subframe indices assert_equals: 'then' property should be added to the end of the string list if not there expected "then" but got "close"
FAIL [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should not reorder where 'then' appears if it's a named subframe, nor add another copy of 'then' assert_equals: expected "then" but got "postMessage"
PASS A and B jointly observe the same identity for cross-origin Window and Location
PASS Cross-origin functions get local Function.prototype
FAIL Cross-origin Window accessors get local Function.prototype Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
FAIL Same-origin observers get different functions for cross-origin objects assert_not_equals: same-origin Window functions get their own object got disallowed value function "function () { [native code] }"
FAIL Same-origin observers get different accessors for cross-origin Window assert_not_equals: different Window accessors per-incumbent script settings object got disallowed value undefined
FAIL Same-origin observers get different accessors for cross-origin Location Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
FAIL {}.toString.call() does the right thing on cross-origin objects assert_equals: expected "[object Object]" but got "[object Location]"
PASS Resolving a promise with a cross-origin window without a 'then' subframe should work.
PASS Resolving a promise with a cross-origin window with a 'then' subframe should work.
PASS Resolving a promise with a cross-origin location should work.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
