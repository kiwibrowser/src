This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Cross-origin: the prototype is null
FAIL Cross-origin: setting the prototype to an empty object via Object.setPrototypeOf should throw a TypeError assert_throws: function "() => {
      Object.setPrototypeOf(target, newValue);
    }" threw object "SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame." ("SecurityError") expected object "TypeError" ("TypeError")
PASS Cross-origin: setting the prototype to an empty object via __proto__ should throw a "SecurityError" DOMException
FAIL Cross-origin: setting the prototype to an empty object via Reflect.setPrototypeOf should return false Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
PASS Cross-origin: the prototype must still be null
FAIL Cross-origin: setting the prototype to null via Object.setPrototypeOf should not throw Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
PASS Cross-origin: setting the prototype to null via __proto__ should throw a "SecurityError" since it ends up in CrossOriginGetOwnProperty
FAIL Cross-origin: setting the prototype to null via Reflect.setPrototypeOf should return true Blocked a frame with origin "http://web-platform.test:8001" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
