Test that keys can be derived from an HKDF key

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS derivedKey.type is "secret"
PASS typeof derivedKey.extractable is 'boolean'
PASS derivedKey.extractable is false
PASS derivedKey.algorithm.name is "AES-GCM"
PASS derivedKey.usages.join(',') is "encrypt"
