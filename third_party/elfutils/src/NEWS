Fix check of various e_*size entries in elflint.

Handle text output in asm_newsym.

Finish checks in asm-tst3.

Improve readelf output format.  Respect various sh_link/sh_info values.
Correctly print versioning information for symbol tables.

Version 0.36:

Implement preprocessing of linker script.  Recognize -z combreloc.

Version 0.35:

Implement -z ignore|record for ld.

Implement creating of .gnu.version_r and .gnu.version sections.  The
.gnu.version does not yet contain correct info for defined and versioned
symbols (means .gnu.version_d is not yet implemented).

Implement gelf_update_* functions to create versioning data.

Version 0.34:

Add DT_RUNPATH/DT_RPATH entries to dynamic section.  Create .plt and
.rel.plt sections (completely).  Add support for all four PLT related
dynamic section entries.  Add callback function for PLT creation.

More tests in elflint.  Add support for very strict checking which for
now flags level 2 (deprecated features) usage.

Version 0.33:

Create dynamic symbol table, dynamic string table, and hash table to ld.

Add hash table histogram support to readelf.

Version 0.32:

more work on elflint

to dynamic section.

Version 0.31:

Start implementing elflint.

Version 0.30:

Fix handling of NOBITS sections in elf_getdata.

Start implementing generation of executables and DSOs in ld.
Generation of program header mostly done.  Address computation done.
Extension of linker script syntax.

Various cleanups.

Implement section group handling in readelf.

Version 0.29:

Implement section groups.  This involved a lot of code moving.  The
new code is entirely untested since gas/gcc are currently not able to
create section groups.  ld works fine on files without section groups.

Version 0.28:

Fix problem with adding more section in elf_newscn.  The section pointers
for the data buffers wasn't adjusted.

Fix elf_getdata with nonzero second parameter.  Correctly handle creation
of internal data buffer for machines without unaligned access.

Start adding support to selectively add sections.  Includes support for
section groups.
Add --gc-sections/--no-gc-sections options.
Add general section merging support.

Fix a bug in section group support in strip.

Fix some potential problems with hash value in dynamic hash implementation.

Version 0.26:

section merging works in ld.

Version 0.25:

Actually create data structures from version map file and use it to hide
symbols in ld.

Implement -s -s for ld.

Version 0.24:

Improve relocation table output in readelf.  Avoid some crashes.
Finish many section handling in readelf.

Finish: finish implementation of ld -r.  At least some simple tests pass.

Version 0.23:

Fix a number of errors in ELF_C_WRITE handling.

Almost finished implementation of ld -r.  The data sections are all copied.
Handling of symbol tables is missing.

Version 0.22:

Handle DSO and archive input files correctly if -r option is given.

Gracefully deal with no phdr in new file in libelf.
Fix various small error handling problems.
Don't mmap file for output unless the command says so.

Add code to create ELF section header table to ld finalize routines.

Version 0.21:

Fix some problems with recursive handling of archives in libelf.

Improve messages printed by nm.

Add symbol binding name handling to libebl.  Fix section name handling in
libebl.

readelf and nm use more libebl functions.

Handle XINDEX correctly in nm and string.

Add first machine ld backend library (i386).
Use it.  Recognize -r and --shared.  Avoid using -lxxx parameters for -r.
Create ELF header in output file.  Change mode of output file according to
output file type.  Reorganize callback initialization in ld.

Version 0.20:

Fix some memory leaks in libelf.

Version 0.19:

Implement reading version script.  Both inside linker scripts and via the
--version-script command line parameter.  Uses the same code.
What remains to be done is to implement a data structure which allows
efficient matching against the version names to decide which pattern
matches.

Beginning of output generation and output writing functions.

Version 0.18:

Finish implementation for DSO input file handling.  Implement rpath, runpath,
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH handling.

Version 0.17:

make handling of e_shnum overflow in libelf standard conforming

ld now actually can handle DSOs in linker scripts.  Handling of DT_RUNPATH,
DT_RPATH, -rpath, -rpath-link still remains to be implemented.

fix handling of -L parameters.  Make actual use of the default_paths element.

make re-definition of symbols in and from DSO compatible with existing linker

Version 0.16:

more work on assigning input sections to output sections.

Add gelf_xlatetof and gelf_xlatetom which were accidently left out.

Fix memory handling of section headers.

Version 0.15:

Add many-section support to ld.  Add various new command line parameters.
Allow pagesize to be specified in linker script or on the command line.
Collect input sections in list for the output section according to the rules
specified in the linker script.

Version 0.14:

Fix some problems in the internal list handling which had the result
that we didn't look for some of the unresolved symbols.

Free some memory if we know we don't need it anymore.

Optimize the list of unresolved symbols.  Throw out symbols which are
meanwhile resolved.

Version 0.13:

Got file reading correct now.  The files are all read while parsing
the parameters.  No creating of data structures to describe the linker
command line.  The symbol table is built up while reading the files.
DSOs are handled now.  -( -) handling is optimized.

Version 0.12:

Linker read linker scripts everywhere.  Handles --whole-archive.  Recognizes
--dynamic and --static.  Collects defined and undefined symbols.  Recognizes
conflicts.

libebl now defines functions to call the callbacks.  Add generic name handling
in these new functions.  Remove the code from readelf and call the new
functions.

Start of linker.  Basic argument parsing, finding of input files,
linker script reading.
