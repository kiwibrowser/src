   string.  Otherwise a default path is used.

   If the first character of the string is + or - that enables or
   disables CRC32 checksum validation when it's necessary.  The
   remainder of the string is composed of elements separated by
   colons.  Each element can start with + or - to override the
   global checksum behavior.  This flag is never relevant when
   working with build IDs, but it's always parsed in the path
   string.  The remainder of the element indicates a directory.

   Searches by build ID consult only the elements naming absolute
   directory paths.  They look under those directories for a link
   named ".build-id/xx/yy" or ".build-id/xx/yy.debug", where "xxyy"
   is the lower-case hexadecimal representation of the ID bytes.

   In searches for debuginfo by name, if the remainder of the
   element is empty, the directory containing the main file is
   tried; if it's an absolute path name, the absolute directory path
   containing the main file is taken as a subdirectory of this path;
   a relative path name is taken as a subdirectory of the directory
   containing the main file.  Hence for /bin/ls, the default string
   ":.debug:/usr/lib/debug" says to look in /bin, then /bin/.debug,
   then /usr/lib/debug/bin, for the file name in the .gnu_debuglink
