    Returns:
      A list of references to the logging handlers added to the root
      logger.  This allows the caller to later remove the handlers
      using logger.removeHandler.  This is useful primarily during unit
      testing where the caller may want to configure logging temporarily
      and then undo the configuring.

    Args:
      logging_level: The minimum logging level to log.  Defaults to
                     logging.INFO.
      logger: A logging.logger instance to configure.  This parameter
              should be used only in unit tests.  Defaults to the
              root logger.
      stream: A file-like object to which to log used in creating the default
              handlers.  The stream must define an "encoding" data attribute,
              or else logging raises an error.  Defaults to sys.stderr.
      handlers: A list of logging.Handler instances to add to the logger
                being configured.  If this parameter is provided, then the
                stream parameter is not used.
      include_time: Include time information at the start of every log message.
