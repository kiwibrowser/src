"""Runs an Apache HTTP server to manually run layout tests locally.

After running this script, you can locally navigate to URLs where
the path is relative to LayoutTests/http/tests/. For example, to run
LayoutTests/http/tests/cachestorage/window-cache-add.html, navigate to:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/cachestorage/window/cache-add.html

When using HTTPS, for example:
    https://127.0.0.1:8443/https/verify-ssl-enabled.php
you will may a certificate warning, which you need to bypass.

After starting the server, you can also run individual layout tests
via content_shell, e.g.
    $ out/Release/content_shell --run-web-tests \
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/cross-frame-access-get.html

Note that some tests will only work if "127.0.0.1" for the host part of the
URL, rather than "localhost".
