"""Runs a WebSocket server for WebSocket tests.

Some tests require both an HTTP server and WebSocket server. You can start
both servers by running both run_blink_httpd.py and
run_blink_websocketserver.py.

Tests served by the HTTP server have paths relative to LayoutTests/http/tests/.
For example, to run a test http/tests/websocket/binary-type.html which depends
on WebSocket, you can navigate to:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/websocket/close-unref-websocket.html
