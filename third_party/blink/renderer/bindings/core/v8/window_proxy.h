// WindowProxy implements the split window model of a window for a frame. In the
// HTML standard, the split window model is composed of the Window interface
// (the inner global object) and the WindowProxy interface (the outer global
// proxy).
//
// The Window interface is backed by the Blink DOMWindow C++ implementation.
// In contrast, the WindowProxy interface does not have a corresponding
// C++ implementation in Blink: the WindowProxy class defined here only manages
// context initialization and detach. Instead, the behavior of the WindowProxy
// interface is defined by JSGlobalProxy in v8 and the prototype chain set up
// during context initialization.
//
// ====== Inner Global Object ======
// The inner global object is the global for the script environment of a Frame.
// Since Window and Document also have a 1:1 relationship, this means that each
// inner global object has an associated Document which does not change. On
// navigation, the new Document receives a new inner global object.
//
// However, there is one exception to the 1:1 DOMWindow:Document rule. If:
// - the previous Document is the initial empty document
// - the new Document is same-origin to the previous Document
// then the inner global object will be reused for the new Document. This is the
// only case where the associated Document of an inner global object can change.
//
// All methods and attributes defined on the Window interface are exposed via
// the inner global object. Global variables defined by script running in the
// Document also live on the inner global object.
//
// ====== Outer Global Proxy ====
// The outer global proxy is reused across navigations. It implements the
// security checks for same-origin/cross-origin access to the Window interface.
// When the check passes (i.e. the access is same-origin), the access is
// forwarded to the inner global object of the active Document in this
// WindowProxy's Frame.
//
// When the security check fails, the access is delegated to the outer global
// proxy's cross-origin interceptors. The cross-origin interceptors may choose
// to return a value (if the property is exposed cross-origin) or throw an
// exception otherwise.
//
// Note that the cross-origin interceptors are only used for cross-origin
// accesses: a same-origin access to a method that is available cross-origin,
// such as Window.postMessage, will be delegated to the inner global object.
//
// ====== LocalWindowProxy vs RemoteWindowProxy ======
// WindowProxy has two concrete subclasses:
// - LocalWindowProxy: implements the split window model for a frame in the same
//   process, i.e. a LocalFrame.
// - RemoteWindowProxy: implements the split window model for a frame in a
//   different process, i.e. a RemoteFrame.
//
// While having a RemoteFrame implies the frame must be cross-origin, the
// opposite is not true: a LocalFrame can be same-origin or cross-origin. One
// additional complexity (which slightly violates the HTML standard): it is
// possible to have SecurityOrigin::CanAccess() return true for a RemoteFrame's
// security origin; however, it is important to still deny access as if the
// frame were cross-origin. This is due to complexities in the process
// allocation model for renderer processes. See https://crbug.com/601629.
//
// ====== LocalWindowProxy ======
// Since a LocalWindowProxy can represent a same-origin or cross-origin frame,
// the entire prototype chain must be available:
//
//   outer global proxy
//     -- has prototype --> inner global object
//     -- has prototype --> Window.prototype
//     -- has prototype --> WindowProperties [1]
//     -- has prototype --> EventTarget.prototype
//     -- has prototype --> Object.prototype
//     -- has prototype --> null
//
// [1] WindowProperties is the named properties object of the Window interface.
//
// ====== RemoteWindowProxy ======
// Since a RemoteWindowProxy only represents a cross-origin frame, it has a much
// simpler prototype chain.
//
//   outer global proxy
//     -- has prototype --> inner global object
//     -- has prototype --> null
//
// Property access to get/set attributes and methods on the outer global proxy
// are redirected through the cross-origin interceptors, since any access will
// fail the security check, by definition.
//
// However, note that method invocations still use the inner global object as
// the receiver object. Blink bindings use v8::Signature to perform a strict
// receiver check, which requires that the FunctionTemplate used to instantiate
// the receiver object matches exactly. However, when creating a new context,
// only inner global object is instantiated using Blink's global template, so by
// definition, it is the only receiver object in the prototype chain that will
// match.

  // |kContextIsInitialized| from a point of view of call sites.
  // - Possible next states: kContextIsInitialized
  // It's possible to detach the context's frame from the DOM or navigate to a
  // new page without initializing the WindowProxy, however, there is no
  // transition to |kFrameIsDetached| or |kGlobalObjectIsDetached|
  // because |DisposeContext| does not change the state if the state is
  // |kContextIsUninitialized|. In either case of a) the browsing context
  // container is detached from the DOM or b) the page is navigated away, there
  // must be no way for author script to access the context of
  // |kContextIsUninitialized| because |kContextIsUninitialized| means that
  // author script has never accessed the context, hence there must exist no
  // reference to the context.
  //
  // * kContextIsInitialized
  // The context is initialized and its frame is still attached to the DOM.
  // - Possible next states: kFrameIsDetached, kGlobalObjectIsDetached
  //
  // * kGlobalObjectIsDetached
  // The context is initialized and its frame is still attached to the DOM, but
  // the global object(inner global)'s Document is no longer the active Document
  // of the frame (i.e. it is being navigated away). The global object (inner
  // global) is detached from the global proxy (outer global), but the
  // (detached) global object and context are still alive, and author script may
  // have references to the context.
  // The spec does not support full web features in this state. Blink supports
  // less things than the spec.
  // This state is also used when swapping frames.  See also |WebFrame::Swap|.
  // - Possible next states: kContextIsInitialized
  // This state is in the middle of navigation. Once document loading is
  // completed, the WindowProxy will always be reinitialized, as
  // |DocumentLoader::InstallNewDocument| ends up calling to
  // |WindowProxy::UpdateDocument|, which reinitializes the WindowProxy.
  //
  // * kFrameIsDetached
  // The context was initialized, but its frame has been detached from the DOM.
  // Note that the context is still alive and author script may have references
  // to the context and hence author script may run in the context.
  // The spec does not support some of web features such as setTimeout, etc. on
  // a detached window. Blink supports less things than the spec.
  // V8PerContextData is cut off from the context.  |global_proxy_| becomes a
  // weak reference so that it's collectable when author script has no
  // reference.
