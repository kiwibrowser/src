"""Generates a .cpp file that includes all V8 binding .cpp files for interfaces.

It is expected to preserve symbol space, and to be acceptable to make static
build on Windows.

Usage:
 $ aggregate_generated_bindings.py --component COMPONENT IDL_FILES_LIST OUTPUT_FILE

 COMPONENT is the relative directory of a component, e.g., 'core', 'modules'.
 IDL_FILES_LIST is a text file containing the IDL file paths
 OUTPUT_FILE is the filename of output file.
