// There are three main states:
// VISIBLE describes frames which are visible to the user (both page and frame
// are visible).
// Without this service frame would have had kBackgrounded state.
// HIDDEN describes frames which are out of viewport but the page is visible
// to the user.
// BACKGROUND describes frames in background pages.
//
// There are four auxillary states:
// VISIBLE_SERVICE describes frames which are treated as visible to the user
// but it is a service (e.g. audio) which forces the page to be foregrounded.
// HIDDEN_SERVICE describes offscreen frames in pages which are treated as
// foregrounded due to a presence of a service (e.g. audio playing).
// BACKGROUND_EXEMPT_SELF describes background frames which are
// exempted from background throttling due to a special conditions being met
// for this frame.
// BACKGROUND_EXEMPT_kOther describes background frames which are exempted from
// background throttling due to other frames granting an exemption for
// the whole page.
//
// Note that all these seven states are disjoint, e.g, when calculating
// a metric for background BACKGROUND, BACKGROUND_EXEMPT_SELF and
// BACKGROUND_EXEMPT_kOther should be added together.
