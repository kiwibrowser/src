// Purpose: to limit the amount of worked queued for execution
//   (backlog) on the GPU by blocking the main thread to allow the GPU
//   to catch up. The Prevents unsynchronized tight animation loops
//   from cause a GPU denial of service.
//
// How it works: The rate limiter uses GPU fences to mark each tick
//   and makes sure there are never more that 'maxPendingTicks' fences
//   that are awaiting completion. On platforms that do not support
//   fences, we use glFinish instead. glFinish will only be called in
//   unsynchronized cases that submit more than maxPendingTicks animation
//   tick per compositor frame, which should be quite rare.
//
// How to use it: Each unit of work that constitutes a complete animation
//   frame must call tick(). reset() must be called when the animation
//   is consumed by committing to the compositor. Several rate limiters can
//   be used concurrently: they will each use their own sequences of
//   fences which may be interleaved. When the graphics context is lost
//   and later restored, the existing rate limiter must be destroyed and
//   a new one created.
