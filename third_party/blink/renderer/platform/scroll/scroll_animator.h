// ScrollAnimator is the Blink-side implementation of user-input scroll offset
// animations ("smooth scrolling") on all platforms except for Mac.
//
// See http://bit.ly/smoothscrolling for general info about user-input smooth
// scrolling.  For the Mac implementation, see ScrollAnimatorMac.  For
// programmatic (CSSOM) smooth scrolls, see ProgrammaticScrollAnimator.
//
// When Blink receives an input event that should start or update a scroll
// animation, it calls ScrollAnimator::UserScroll.  This will construct an
// animation curve object which can report the desired scroll offset as a
// function of elapsed time.  See cc/animation/scroll_offset_animation_curve.h
// for more info about the animation curve logic (including velocity-matched
// target updating).
//
// Having established an animation curve, the logic for servicing the animation
// is highly dependent on compositing.  There are four scenarios to consider:
//
// (1) Scroll animation running on the compositor, scheduled by the compositor
//     (LayerTreeHostImpl::ScrollAnimated) in response to a scroll wheel input
//     event handled by the compositor thread.  Blink doesn't know about these.
//
// (2) Scroll animation running on the compositor, scheduled by Blink.  For
//     example, a keyboard scroll of a composited scroller.
//
// (3) Scroll animation of a composited scroller, running on the main thread due
//     to main-thread scrolling reasons (for example, non-composited fixed-
//     position elements that need to be repainted on scroll).
//
// (4) Scroll animation of a non-composited scroller, running on the main
//     thread.
//
// In scenarios (1) and (2) the animation is created as a cc::Animation with
// TargetProperty::SCROLL_OFFSET and added to a cc::Animation that is
// serviced on the compositor thread (in cc::AnimationHost::TickAnimations).
// This lets the animation play smoothly even if the main thread is janked.
//
// In scenarios (3) and (4), we schedule the animation ticks on the main thread
// using ScrollableArea::ScheduleAnimation, and update the scroll offset during
// ScrollAnimator::TickAnimation.
//
// There is a special main-thread scrolling reason kHandlingScrollFromMainThread
// set in scenarios (2) and (3) for the duration of the scroll, to prevent
// interference from events that would otherwise trigger scenario (1).
//
// There is a complicated handoff from (1) to (3) in the event that a main-
// thread scrolling reason is added in the middle of an animation.  This is
// handled by TakeOverCompositorAnimation, which aborts the animation in cc and
// sends an AnimationEvent::TAKEOVER back to the main thread containing a copy
// of the curve.  That calls back into NotifyAnimationTakeover which starts a
// new animation on main to play the "remainder" of the curve.
//
// The logic for Blink-side scheduling of compositor-serviced scroll offset
// animations is shared with ProgrammaticScrollAnimator, and lives mostly in the
// common base class ScrollAnimatorCompositorCoordinator.
