<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>


The following individuals and groups are to be acknowledged for their
contributions to Mesa over the years.
This list is far from complete and somewhat dated, unfortunately.


<ul>
<li>Early Mesa development was done while Brian was part of the
<a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis.html"
target="_parent">SSEC Visualization Project</a> at the University of
Wisconsin. He'd like to thank Bill Hibbard for letting him work on
Mesa as part of that project.
<br>
<br>
<li>John Carmack of id Software, Inc. funded Keith Whitwell in 1999 in
order to optimize Mesa's vertex transformation module. This is a very
substantial piece of work.
<br>
<br>
<li>Precision Insight, Inc., VA Linux Systems, Inc., and most recently,
Tungsten Graphics, Inc. have supported the ongoing development of Mesa.
<br>
<br>
<li>The
<a href="http://www.mesa3d.org" target="_parent">Mesa</a>
website is hosted by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_parent">

<li><b>Bernd Barsuhn</b> wrote the evaluator code for (splines,
patches) in Mesa.

<li><b>Bernhard Tschirren</b> wrote the Allegro DJGPP driver.

<li><b>Bogdan Sikorski</b> wrote the GLU NURBS and polygon tessellator
in Mesa.

<li><b>Gareth Hughes</b> wrote new GLU 1.2 Polygon Tessellation code
(now superceded by SGI SI GLU).

<li><b>Holger Waechtler</b> contributed AMD 3DNow! assembly code which
