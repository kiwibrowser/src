Description:
This is a modified copy of the swipe refresh layout widget (and its two
dependencies) from Android's app compat library (v4). The widget provides a
pull-to-refresh styled layout for touch-activated refresh of view contents.

Local Modifications:

CircleImageView
  * The package has been changed, and most ViewCompat dependencies removed.

MaterialProgressDrawable
  * The package has been changed, and most ViewCompat dependencies removed.
  * The class has been made visible outside of the package.

SwipeRefreshLayout
  * MotionEvent-behavior has been changed to allow more abstract inputs.
  * Target View semantics have been removed, allowing it to operate on
    a parent View rather than a child View.
  * All ViewCompat and MotionEventCompat dependencies removed.
  * Added OnResetListener interface to notify SwipeRefreshHandler to detach
    this view.
