Description:
Alternative to SQLite used as the backend for IndexedDB and internally by the
FileSystem API implementation and others.

Currently using (not yet released) manifest reuse feature for all platforms
except Chrome OS.

Local Additions:
* GN file for building in chromium
* port/port_chromium.{h,cc} and env_chromium.{h,cc} provide chromium
  implementations of primitives used by leveldb.  E.g. threading, file handling,
  etc. env_chromium.h allows re-use of some utility functions.
* chromium_logger.h was copied from src/util/posix_logger.h and updated to use
  chrome primitives in place of some posix primitives
* Logging of uma statistics. Can be overridden by derived class to redirect to
  different histogram.
* TRACE macros/thread name for chrome://tracing diagnostics
* Handle in-process exclusive file locks, based on src/util/env_posix.cc
* Unit tests for the Chromium environment.
* db_bench is built as leveldb_db_bench in Chromium.
* leveldb_chrome::NewMemEnv() to create memory Env instances that are tracked to
  know if a database open request is in-memory. These memory Env instances report
  memory usage to memory-infra.
