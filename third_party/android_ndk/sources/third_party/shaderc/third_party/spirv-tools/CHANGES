   #755: Inliner: Fix inlining of callee with single Return appearing before
     the end of the function.

 - Fix https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/issues/261
   Turn off ClipDistance and CullDistance capability checks for Vulkan.
 - The disassembler can emit friendly names based on debug info (OpName
   instructions), and will infer somewhat friendly names for most types.
   This is turned on by default for the spirv-dis command line tool.
 - Updated to support SPIR-V 1.1 rev 2
   - Input StorageClass, Sampled1D capability, and SampledBuffer capability
     do not require Shader capability anymore.

     - Supports integer widths up to 64 bits
   - Validator is incomplete
