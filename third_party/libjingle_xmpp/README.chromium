Description:
XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is a communications protocol
for messaging based on XML. xmllite is a minimalistic library for parsing and
generating XML. The source for these libraries originates from the libjingle
project, which was merged into the WebRTC codebase where it received minor
updates. The code in the task_runner subdirectory used to live in
third_party/webrtc/base, and it is a dependency for these libraries and
Chromium's jingle component. As time passed, the code was no longer used in
WebRTC but is still used in Chromium. Only the parts that are used in Chromium
are added here.

Nothing but Chromium uses this copy. If code in this directory is found to be
unused in Chromium, it's OK to delete it.

Local Modifications:
* Include paths in third_party/libjingle_xmpp/xmllite,
  third_party/libjingle_xmpp/xmpp, and third_party/libjingle_xmpp/task_runner
  are updated to reflect the new absolute paths to their own and webrtc's
  headers.
* disabled unstarted_task_test.DoNotDeleteTask2 under ASan
