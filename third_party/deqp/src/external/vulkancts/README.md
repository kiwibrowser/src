Vulkan CTS README
=================

This document describes how to build and run Vulkan Conformance Test suite.

Vulkan CTS is built on dEQP framework. dEQP documentation is available
at http://source.android.com/devices/graphics/testing.html


Requirements
------------

### Common

 * Git (for checking out sources)
 * Python 2.7.x (all recent versions in 2.x should work, 3.x is not supported)
 * CMake 2.8 or newer

### Win32

 * Visual Studio 2013 or newer (glslang uses several C++11 features)

### Linux

 * Standard toolchain (make, gcc/clang)

### Android

 * Android NDK r11
 * Android SDK with: SDK Tools, SDK Platform-tools, SDK Build-tools, and API 22
 * Java Development Kit (JDK)
 * Windows: either NMake or Ninja in PATH

If you have downloaded Android SDK tools, you can install necessary components
by running:

	tools/android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter tools,platform-tools,build-tools-25.0.2,android-22


Building CTS
------------

To build dEQP, you need first to download sources for zlib, libpng, glslang,
and spirv-tools.

To download sources, run:

	python external/fetch_sources.py

You may need to re-run `fetch_sources.py` to update to the latest glslang and
spirv-tools revisions occasionally.

With CMake out-of-source builds are always recommended. Create a build directory
of your choosing, and in that directory generate Makefiles or IDE project
using cmake.


### Windows x86-32

	cmake <path to vulkancts> -G"Visual Studio 12"
	start dEQP-Core-default.sln

### Windows x86-64

	cmake <path to vulkancts> -G"Visual Studio 12 Win64"
	start dEQP-Core-default.sln

### Linux 32-bit Debug

	cmake <path to vulkancts> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m32 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32
	make -j

Release build can be done by using -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

### Linux 64-bit Debug

	cmake <path to vulkancts> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m64 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m64
	make -j

### Android

Following command will build dEQP.apk:

	python scripts/android/build_apk.py

The package can be installed by either running:

	python scripts/android/install_apk.py

By default the CTS package will contain libdeqp.so built for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a,
x86, and x86_64 ABIs, but that can be changed using --abis command line option.

To pick which ABI to use at install time, following commands must be used
instead:

	adb install --abi <ABI name> <build-root>/package/dEQP.apk /data/local/tmp/dEQP-debug.apk


Building Mustpass
-----------------

Current mustpass is checked into repository and can be found at:

	external/vulkancts/mustpass/1.0.2/vk-default.txt

Vulkan CTS mustpass can be re-generated by running:

	python <vulkancts>/external/vulkancts/scripts/build_mustpass.py


Pre-compiling SPIR-V binaries
-----------------------------

For distribution, and platforms that don't support GLSL to SPIR-V compilation,
SPIR-V binaries can be pre-built with following command:

	python external/vulkancts/scripts/build_spirv_binaries.py

Binaries will be written to `external/vulkancts/data/vulkan/prebuilt/`.

Test modules (or in case of Android, the APK) must be re-built after building
SPIR-V programs in order for the binaries to be available.


Running CTS
-----------

Following command line options MUST be used when running CTS:

	--deqp-caselist-file=<vulkancts>/external/vulkancts/mustpass/1.0.2/vk-default.txt
	--deqp-log-images=disable
	--deqp-log-shader-sources=disable

In addition on multi-device systems the device for which conformance is claimed
can be selected with:

	--deqp-vk-device-id=<value>

To speed up the conformance run on some platforms the following command line
option may be used to disable frequent fflush() calls to the output logs:

	--deqp-log-flush=disable

By default, the test log will be written into the path "TestResults.qpa". If the
platform requires a different path, it can be specified with:

	--deqp-log-filename=<path>

No other command line options are allowed.

### Win32

	cd <builddir>/external/vulkancts/modules/vulkan
	Debug/deqp-vk.exe --deqp-caselist-file=...

Test log will be written into TestResults.qpa

### Linux

	cd <builddir>/external/vulkancts/modules/vulkan
	./deqp-vk --deqp-vk-caselist-file=...

### Android

	adb push <vulkancts>/external/vulkancts/mustpass/1.0.2/vk-default.txt /sdcard/vk-default.txt
	adb shell

In device shell:

	am start -n com.drawelements.deqp/android.app.NativeActivity -e cmdLine "deqp --deqp-caselist-file=/sdcard/vk-default.txt --deqp-log-images=disable --deqp-log-shader-sources=disable --deqp-log-filename=/sdcard/TestResults.qpa"

Test progress will be written to device log and can be displayed with:

	adb logcat -s dEQP

Test log will be written into `/sdcard/TestResults.qpa`.


Conformance Submission Package Requirements
-------------------------------------------

The conformance submission package must contain the following:

1. Full test logs (`TestResults.qpa`) from CTS runs against all driver builds
2. Result of `git status` and `git log` from CTS source directory
3. Any patches used on top of release tag
4. Conformance statement

Test logs (1) should be named `<submission pkg dir>/TestResults-<driver build type>.qpa`,
for example `TestResults-armeabi-v7a.qpa`. On platforms where multiple different driver
builds (for example 64-bit and 32-bit) are present, CTS logs must be provided
for each driver build as part of the submission package.

The CTS build must always be done from clean git repository that doesn't have any
uncommitted changes. Thus it is necessary to run and capture output of `git
status` and `git log` (2) in the source directory:

	git status > <submission pkg dir>/git-status.txt
	git log --first-parent <release tag>^..HEAD > <submission pkg dir>/git-log.txt

Any changes made to CTS must be committed to the local repository, and provided
as part of the submission package (3). This can be done by running:

	git format-patch -o <submission pkg dir> <release tag>..HEAD

In general, bugfixes and changes to platform-specific code (mostly under
`framework/platform`) are allowed. The commit message for each change must
include a clear description of the change and why it is necessary. Non-porting
related changes must be accompanied by a waiver (see below).

NOTE: When cherry-picking patches on top of release tag, please use `git cherry-pick -x`
to include original commit hash in the commit message.

Conformance statement (4) must be included in a file called `STATEMENT-<adopter>`
and must contain following:

	CONFORM_VERSION:         <git tag of CTS release>
	PRODUCT:                 <string-value>
	CPU:                     <string-value>
	OS:                      <string-value>

Note that product/cpu/os information is also captured in `dEQP-VK.info.*` tests
if `vk::Platform::describePlatform()` is implemented.

If the submission package covers multiple products, you can list them by appending
additional `PRODUCT:` lines to the conformance statement. For example:

	CONFORM_VERSION:         vulkan-cts-1.0.2.0
	PRODUCT:                 Product A
	PRODUCT:                 Product B
	...

The actual submission package consists of the above set of files which must
be bundled into a gzipped tar file named `VK10_<adopter><_info>.tgz`. `<adopter>`
is the name of the Adopting member company, or some recognizable abbreviation.
The `<_info>` field is optional. It may be used to uniquely identify a submission
by OS, platform, date, or other criteria when making multiple submissions.

One way to create a suiteable gzipped tar file is to execute the command:

	tar -cvzf <filename.tgz> -C <submission pkg dir> .

where `<submission pkg dir>` is the directory containing the files from (1)-(4)
from above. A submission package must contain all of the files listed above,
and only those files.

As an example submission package could contain:

	STATEMENT-Khronos
	git-log.txt
	git-status.txt
	0001-Remove-Waived-Filtering-Tests.patch
	0002-Fix-Pipeline-Parameters.patch
	TestResults-armeabi-v7a.qpa
	TestResults-arm64-v8a.qpa


Waivers
-------

The process for requesting a waiver is to report the issue by filing a bug
report in the Gitlab VulkanCTS project (TODO Github?). When creating the
submission package, include references to the waiver in the commit message of
the relevant change. Including as much information as possible in your bug
report (including a unified diff or a merge request of suggested file changes)
will ensure the issue can be progressed as rapidly as possible. Issues must
be labeled "Waiver" (TODO!) and identify the version of the CTS and affected
tests.

Conformance Criteria
--------------------

Conformance run is considered passing if all tests finish with allowed result
codes. Test results are contained in the TestResults.qpa log. Each
test case section contains XML tag Result, for example:

	<Result StatusCode="Pass">Not validated</Result>

The result code is the value of the StatusCode attribute. Following status
codes are allowed:

	Pass
	NotSupported
	QualityWarning
	CompatibilityWarning

Submission package can be verified using `external/vulkancts/scripts/verify_submission.py`
script. The script takes two arguments: path to extracted submission package
and path to current mustpass list. For example:

	python external/vulkancts/scripts/verify_submission.py VK_10_Khronos_1/ external/vulkancts/mustpass/1.0.2/vk-default.txt


Vulkan platform port
--------------------

Vulkan support from Platform implementation requires providing
`getVulkanPlatform()` method in `tcu::Platform` class implementation.

See `framework/common/tcuPlatform.hpp` and examples in
`framework/platform/win32/tcuWin32Platform.cpp` and
`framework/platform/android/tcuAndroidPlatform.cpp`.

If any WSI extensions are supported, platform port must also implement
methods for creating native display (`vk::Platform::createWsiDisplay`)
and window handles (`vk::wsi::Display::createWindow`). Otherwise tests
under `dEQP-VK.wsi` will fail.


Null (dummy) driver
-------------------

For testing and development purposes it might be useful to be able to run
tests on dummy Vulkan implementation. One such implementation is provided in
vkNullDriver.cpp. To use that, implement `vk::Platform::createLibrary()` with
`vk::createNullDriver()`.


Validation Layers
-----------------

Vulkan CTS framework includes first-party support for validation layers, that
can be turned on with `--deqp-validation=enable` command line option.

When validation is turned on, default instance and device will be created with
validation layers enabled and debug callback is registered to record any
messages. Debug messages collected during test execution will be included at
the end of the test case log.

If any validation errors are found, test result will be set to `InternalError`.

By default `VK_DEBUG_REPORT_INFORMATION_BIT_EXT` and `_DEBUG_BIT_EXT` messages
are excluded from the log, but that can be customized by modifying
`vkt::TestCaseExecutor::deinit()` in `vktTestPackage.cpp`.


Cherry GUI
----------

Vulkan test module can be used with Cherry (GUI for test execution and
analysis). Cherry is available at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/cherry. Please follow
instructions in README to get started.

Before first launch, and every time test hierarchy has been modified, test
case list must be refreshed by running:

	python scripts/build_caselists.py path/to/cherry/data

Cherry must be restarted for the case list update to take effect.
