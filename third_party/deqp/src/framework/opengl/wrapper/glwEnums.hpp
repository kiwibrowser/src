 * \note Do not include this anywhere where you'd like to include native
 *		 GL headers or otherwise preprocessor will be rather unhappy about
 *		 duplicate declarations.
 *
 * \todo [2013-04-08 pyry] This is .hpp just for consistency. Should we make
 *						   it .h instead since it doesn't contain anything
 *						   C++ -specific.
