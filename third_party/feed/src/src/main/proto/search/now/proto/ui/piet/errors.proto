// Each error in Piet is described by a unique error code. Error levels indicate
// how the issue should be handled by server implementations and client
// implementations.
//
// Error handling in Piet is roughly modeled after Postel’s Law:
// “Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept”.
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle
//
// Servers will inform feature authors of problems in built protos as early and
// as loudly as possible, to ensure that we are conservative in sending protos
// to the client.
//
// Clients attempt their best in rendering protos, even if there are potential
// errors as long as there is a reasonable way to recover with work-arounds and
// defaults.
//
// Thus, two error levels are specified for each error code, allowing us to
// treat the same issue with different treatments on the server and client.
