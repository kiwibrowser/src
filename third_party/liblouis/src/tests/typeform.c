/* This is not a test per se, i.e. it doesn't invoke any functionality

   Instead it just invokes the liblouis translation machinery on a
   fairly large text. This is done simply to be able to run valgrind
   on a big translation.

   Thanks to this a number of bugs have been found and as I write this
   there are still some memory problems remaining. There are errors
   such as Invalid reads and writes, Conditional jump or move depends
   on uninitialized value and Use of uninitialized value.

   you can use valgrind to find and possibly fix the remaining

Do cats eat\n                        bats?\" and sometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you\n                    see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she\n                    put it.

There was\n                    not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was\n                    just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears\n                        and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close behind it when she\n                    turned the corner, but the Rabbitwas no longer to be seen: she\n                    found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n                    from the roof.",

However, on the second time round, she came\n                    upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door\n                    about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to\n                    her great delight it fitted!",

		"\"That was a narrow escape!\" said Alice, a good deal\n                    frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\n                    existence; \"and now for the garden!\" and she ran with all speed back to the\n                    little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\n                    key was lying on the glass table as before, \"and things are worse than ever,\"\n                    thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this before, never!

		"Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and\n                    she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a\n                    walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she\n                    soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.",

So she began\n                    again: \"Ou est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in\n                    her French lesson-book. The Mousegave a sudden leap out of the\n                    water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your\n                        pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\n                    poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like\n                        cats.\"",

		"So she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk\n                    about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the\n                    Mouseheard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\n                    face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a\n                    low trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\n                    history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"",
		"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and\n                    animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an\n                    Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and\n                    the whole party swam to the shore.",

		"They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank-the birds with\n                    draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all\n                    dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
		"The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation\n                    about this, ",
		"30",
		" and after a few minutes it seemed quite\n                    natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as\n                    if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with\n                    the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \"I am older than you,\n                    and must know better;\" and this Alice would not allow without\n                    knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age,\n                    there was no more to be said.",
		"At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,\n                    \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'll soon make you dry\n                    enough!\" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\n                    Mousein the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously\n                    fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry\n                    very soon.",
		"\"Ahem!\" said the Mousewith an important air, \"are you all ready?\n                    This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!\n                        'William the Conqueror, whose cause was ",

		"\"Ugh!\" said the Lory, with a shiver.",
		"\"I beg your pardon?\" said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \"Did you\n                    speak?\"",
		"\"Not I!\" said the Lory hastily.",
		"\"I thought you did,\" said the Mouse. -\"I proceed. 'Edwin and\n                        Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\n                        Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it\n                    advisable-'\"",
		"\"Found what?\" said the Duck.",
		"\"Found it,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly: \"of course you know\n                    what 'it' means.\"",
		"\"I know what 'it' means well enough, when I find a thing,\" said the Duck: \"it's\n                    generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\"",

But the insolence of his Normans-' How are you getting on now, my\n                    dear?\" it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.",
		"\"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone: \"it doesn't seem\n                    to dry me at all.\"",
		"\"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the\n                    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies-\"",
		"\"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long\n                    words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\" And the Eaglet bent\n                    down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.",
		"\"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"was, that the best\n                    thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"",
		"\"What is a Caucus-race?\" said Alice; not that she wanted much to\n                    know, but the Dodo ",
		"33",
		" had paused as if it\n                    thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed\n                    inclined to say anything.",
		"\"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" (And, as you\n                    might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the\n                    Dodo managed it.)",
		"First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\"the exact shape doesn't\n                    matter,\" it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and\n                    there. There was no \"One, two, three, and away,\" but they began running when\n                    they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when\n                    the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and\n                    were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \"The race is over!\" and they\n                    all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \"But who has won?\"",
		"This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it\n                    sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its ",
		"34",
		" forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,\n                    in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\n                    said, \"everybody has won, and all must have prizes.\"",
		"\"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.",
		"\"Why, she, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice\n                    with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\n                    confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\"",
		"Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n                    pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got\n                    into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all\n                    round.",
		"\"But she must have a prize herself, you know,\" said the Mouse.",
		"\"Of course,\" the Dodo replied very gravely. \"What else have you got in your\n                    pocket?\" he went on, turning to Alice.",
		"\"Only a thimble,\" said Alice sadly.",
		"\"Hand it over here,\" said the Dodo.",
		"35",
		"Dodo presenting thimble",
		"Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the\n                    thimble, saying \"We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\" and, when it\n                    had finished this short speech, they all cheered.",
		"36",
		"Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so\n                    grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to\n                    say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.",
		"The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as\n                    the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones\n                    choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they\n                    sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouseto tell them\n                    something more.",
		"\"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and\n                    why it is you hate-C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would\n                    be offended again.",
		"\"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice,\n                    and sighing.",
		"It is a long tail, certainly,\" said\n                        Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on puzzling about\n                    it while the Mousewas speaking, ",
