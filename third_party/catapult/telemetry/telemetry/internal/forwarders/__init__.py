    By default this means mapping a known local_port with a remote_port. If the
    remote_port is missing (e.g. 0 or None) then the forwarder will choose an
    available port on the device.

    Conversely, when reverse=True, a known remote_port is mapped to a
    local_port and, if this is missing, then the forwarder will choose an
    available port on the host.

      local_port: An http port on the local host.
      remote_port: An http port on the remote device.
      reverse: A Boolean indicating the direction of the mapping.
