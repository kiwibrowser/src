Description:
BDD / TDD assertion framework for node.js and the browser that can be paired with any testing framework.

Local Modifications:
Copied license text out of README.md. Unminified chai.js and ripped out parts pertaining to Buffer because we're not using node and don't want could-not-require exceptions to be thrown. Reminified to prevent jslint from complaining.
