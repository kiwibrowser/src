Local Modifications:
Although the whole repository is pulled, we only use dist/oboe-browser.js and dist/oboe-node.js. There are some local modifications, explained below:

* dist/oboe-node.js:1092: the internal 'http' module is used to remove dependency on external the 'http-https' module.
* dist/oboe-node.js:2439-2442: two methods (write, finish) are exposed in the public API for manually sending data to the parser.
* dist/oboe-browser.js:2545-2548: two methods (write, finish) are exposed in the public API for manually sending data to the parser.
