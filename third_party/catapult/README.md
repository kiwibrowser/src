Catapult
========

Catapult is the home for several performance tools that span from gathering,
displaying and analyzing performance data. This includes:

 * [Trace-viewer](/tracing/README.md)
 * [Telemetry](/telemetry/README.md)
 * [Performance Dashboard](/dashboard/README.md)
 * [Systrace](/systrace/README.md)
 * [Web Page Replay](/web_page_replay_go/README.md)

These tools were created by Chromium developers for performance analysis,
testing, and monitoring of Chrome, but they can also be used for analyzing and
monitoring websites, and eventually Android apps.
