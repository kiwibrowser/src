2.0.1
-----

* Fix setup.py for six dependency: move the six dependency from extras_require
  to install_requires.

* Port paste.proxy to Python 3.

* Fix paste.exceptions.serial_number_generator.hash_identifier() on Python 3.

* Fix paste.util.threadedprint.uninstall(). Rename duplicated uninstall()
  function to uninstall_stdin() and fix typo in variable name (_oldstin =>
  _oldstdin).

* Add README.rst file.

2.0
---

* Experimental Python 3 support.

* paste now requires the six module.

* Drop support of Python 2.5 and older.

* Fixed ``egg:Paste#cgi``

* In ``paste.httpserver``: give a 100 Continue response even when the
  server has been configured as an HTTP/1.0 server (clients may send
  ``Expect: 100-Continue`` before they know the version), and wrap
  100 Continue ``environ['wsgi.input']`` files with LimitedLengthFile
  just like normal request bodies are wrapped, keeping WSGI
  applications from over-reading from the socket.

* Fixed parsing of paths beginning with multiple forward slashes.

* Add tox.ini to run tests with tox on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4.

1.7.5.1
-------

* Fix bug introduced in :mod:`paste.auth.auth_tkt` (with ``url_unquote``)

1.7.5
-----

* Won't install ``tests/`` directory (also caused installation
  problems on some Mac systems).

* Fixed problem with gzip middleware and zero-length responses.

* Use ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in :mod:`paste.translogger`

* Fixed problems with mimeparse code

* Fixed some corner cases with CGI scripts

* :mod:`paste.auth.auth_tkt` will URL-quote usernames, avoiding some
  errors with usernames with ``!`` in them.

* Improve handling of errors in fetching error pages in
  :mod:`paste.errordocument`.

1.7.4
-----

* Fix XSS bug (security issue) with not found handlers for
  :class:`paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser` and
  :class:`paste.urlmap.URLMap`.  If you ask for a path with
  ``/--><script>...`` that will be inserted in the error page and can
  execute Javascript.  Reported by Tim Wintle with further details
  from Georg-Christian Pranschke.

* Replaced :func:`paste.util.mimeparse.desired_match`

1.7.3.1
-------

* Removed directory name from 404 errors in
  :class:`paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser`.

* Fixed packaging to include Javascript and images for
  :mod:`paste.evalexception`

1.7.3
-----

* I got a fever and the only prescription is more :mod:`paste.cowbell`!

* Fix :mod:`paste.httpserver` on Python 2.6.

* Fix :mod:`paste.auth.cookie`, which would insert newlines for long
  cookies.

* :mod:`paste.util.mimeparse` parses a single ``*`` in Accept headers
  (sent by IE 6).

* Fix some problems with the ``wdg_validate`` middleware.

* Improvements to :mod:`paste.auth.auth_tkt`: add httponly support,
  don't always aggressively set cookies without the
  ``wildcard_cookie`` option.  Also on logout, make cookies expire.

* In :class:`paste.proxy.Proxy` handle Content-Length of -1.

* In :mod:`paste.httpexceptions` avoid some unicode errors.

* In :mod:`paste.httpserver` handle ``.read()`` from 100 Continue
  properly (because of a typo it was doing a readline).

* Update ``paste.util.mimeparse`` from `upstream
  <http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/>`_.

1.7.2
-----

* In :mod:`paste.proxy`, added some more headers that are disallowed
  in WSGI (e.g., Keep-Alive).  Send Content-Length.  Also fix the
  missing query string when using :class:`paste.proxy.Proxy`
  (:class:`paste.proxy.TransparentProxy` already worked).

* Make :mod:`paste.debug.prints` work with Google App Engine.

* Make ``environ['wsgi.input']`` with :mod:`paste.httpserver` only
  have a ``seek`` method if it is wrapping something with a seek
  method (which usually it is not).

* In :mod:`paste.httpserver` re-raise KeyboardInterrupt in worker
  threads.

* Added support for the ``HttpOnly`` Cookie property to
  :mod:`paste.wsgiwrappers`

* Added :func:`paste.reloader.add_file_callback`, which lets you watch
  files based on a callback.

* Quiet Python 2.6 deprecation warnings.

* Fix :mod:`paste.auth.cookie` generating bad headers.

* Added :class:`paste.reloader.JythonMonitor` for an experimental,
  optimized reloader on Jython.

1.7.1
-----

* Normalize and make absolute the paths passed to
  :class:`paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser` (before passing a
  relative-to-cwd path to that class would cause Forbidden errors).

* Deprecate :func:`paste.fixture.setup_module`

1.7
---

* Fixed bug in :class:`paste.fixture.TestApp` that would submit forms
  with unnamed fields (like an unnamed submit button).  Also made
  checkboxes with no explicit ``value`` send ``on`` instead of
  ``checked`` (which is what browsers do).

* Fixed bug in :mod:`paste.httpserver` where
  ``environ['wsgi.input'].readline(max_size)`` ignored the max_size
  argument, which can lead to large memory usage (from Jakub Stolarski)

* Make :mod:`paste.cascade` notice sockets that have stopped producing
  data.  From Casey Zednick.

* In :class:`paste.fixture.TestApp` Accept MultiDict values for the
  ``params`` argument in requests.  (Anything with a ``.items()``
  method will have its items encoded as the request parameters.)

* Fix :mod:`paste.httpserver` to allow binding to port 0.

* In :mod:`paste.auth.auth_tkt`, set the same cookies (with the same
  domains) in ``set_cookie`` as get unset in ``logout_user_cookie``.

* In :mod:`paste.translogger` save REQUEST_METHOD in case it gets
  overridden somewhere (e.g., when using errordocuments POST would
  show up as GET).

* Exceptions with unicode messages don't cause the collector to fail.

* Sometimes :class:`paste.exceptions.errormiddleware.ErrorMiddleware`
  would not call start_response properly; this is fixed (from Andreas
  Kloecker).

* :mod:`paste.fixture.TestApp` can store multiple cookie values
  (previously only one cookie was stored; from Andrey Lebedev)

* ``u'' in TestApp(app).get('/')`` will work when the body isn't ASCII
  (before it would give a unicode error).  This problem wasn't present
  in the recommended `WebTest <http://pythonpaste.org/webtest/>`_.

* :mod:`paste.debug.profile` won't break when content is served with no
  Content-Type.

* Accept relative paths and paths with ``/../`` in them for
  :class:`paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser` (from Eric Larson).  Also fix
  problem with case normalization on Windows (from Ionel Maries
  Cristian).

* :class:`paste.registry.StackedObjectProxy`'s now include the proxied object's names via
  ``__dir__`` (for Python 2.6).

* Use ``environ['wsgi.file_wrapper']`` when available (in
  ``paste.fileapp``).

* Make :mod:`paste.debug.prints` compatible with App Engine.

* Fix the ``domain`` keyword in
  :meth:`paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIResponse.delete_cookie`.

1.6.1
-----

* Fixed bug in paste lint where PATH_INFO would become unicode.

1.6
---

* Make the import of ``socket.sslerror`` conditional in
  ``paste.exceptions.reporter`` (needed for Python interpreters
  compiled without SSL support).

* In ``paste.proxy.TransparentProxy``, don't overwrite
  ``X-Forwarded-For`` header if it is already in the environment.

* Added ``226 IM Used`` status code to ``paste.wsgiwrappers``

* In ``paste.fixture.TestApp`` treat ``<image type="image">`` the same
  as a submit button.

* Use ``OpenSSL.tsafe.Connection`` for https with
  ``paste.httpserver``, avoiding some possible errors (``sslv3 alert
  bad record mac``).

* Fix small issue with ``paste.cgiapp`` and mod_wsgi.

* Use ``BaseCookie`` instead of ``SimpleCookie`` for storing cookies
  (avoids quoting cookie values).

1.5.1
-----

* Make ``paste.cascade`` more tolerant of a missing or invalid
  Content-Length.

1.5
---

* Fixed memory leak with ``paste.registry`` not properly removing
  all references to registered objects should register be called
  multiple times during a single context for a StackedObjectProxy.

* ``paste.httpheaders.CONTENT_RANGE`` returns ``bytes
  START-END/LENGTH`` instead of just ``START-END/LENGTH``

* In ``paste.fixture.TestApp`` set ``CONTENT_TYPE`` to
  ``'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`` whenever there are
  parameters (and no other content type was provided).

* In ``paste.session``, when cleaning files ignore files that aren't
  session files.

* ``paste.httpexceptions.HTTPExceptionHandler`` will no longer catch
  exceptions raised during the app_iter iteration.

* ``paste.cascade.Cascade`` copies ``wsgi.input`` when cascading, so
  that one of the applications cannot read the input and leave a later
  application blocked when it tries to read the input.

* Fix assigning to ``WSGIResponse.charset`` breaking the content-type.

* SMTP authentication is supported for the exception handler.  You may
  now set ``smtp_username``, ``smtp_password`` and ``smtp_use_tls`` to
  control this behavior.  From pthy.

1.4.2
-----

* Remove FreeBSD threadpool condition in paste.httpserver (which was
  also breaking code for Windows users).

* Fix problem with ``paste.wsgilib.intercept_output`` and passing up
  exceptions.

1.4.1
-----

* Allow customization of the ``paste.config.ConfigMiddleware`` environ
  key.

* Added a ``current`` method (an alias of ``current_conf``) to
  ``paste.config.DispatchingConfig``.

* Make test response ``.form`` attribute work when you have a single
  named form.

* Try to encode any unicode input to ``paste.auth.auth_tkt``

* ``paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIResponse`` now has a ``.content_type``
  attribute (that does not include parameters), and a ``.charset``
  attribute (that gets the charset parameter).

* Inherit inherit show_exceptions_in_wsgi_errors from global
  configuration.  Inherit ``debug`` more properly.

1.4
---

* In ``paste.httpserver`` added lots of functionality to the
  threadpool.  See `the paste.httpserver threadpool documentation
  <paste-httpserver-threadpool.html>`_ for details.  This catches
  worker threads (and WSGI apps) that take too long to complete their
  task; killing them eventually, adding more worker threads when the
  pool is exhausted and it doesn't look good that it'll clear soon,
  and optionally killing the process when there are too many
  lost/zombie threads (you must be using some kind supervisor process
  for this last response to make sense).

* Save host and scheme information during real HTTP proxy requests to
  ``paste.httpserver``, into the keys
  ``paste.httpserver.proxy.scheme`` and
  ``paste.httpserver.proxy.host``

* In ``paste.exceptions`` always call ``start_response``; may help
  problems when there is an exception in ``start_response`` itself.

* Added method to ``paste.registry.StackedObjectProxy``,
  ``_object_stack()``, which returns a list of all the registered
  objects.  Useful if you want to search through the effective history
  of a stacked object.

* Fixed infinite recursion problem with
  ``paste.request.EnvironHeaders.keys()``.

* Fix ``paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIRequest.urlvars`` to use
  ``wsgiorg.routing_args``

* Remove port from ``paste.request.construct_url`` if it's the default
  port (e.g., port 80 for ``http``).

* ``paste.proxy`` works with headers with continuations in the
  response (i.e., a header that spans multiple lines).  Also, treat a
  missing Content-Length as 0, not unlimited (may have previously
  caused freeze ups for some kinds of requests).

* ``StackedObjectProxy`` supports ``__call__`` (i.e., you can use
  ``StackedObjectProxy`` with callable objects).

* Fixed ``ProfileMiddleware`` not calling ``close()`` on consumed
  app_iters.

* ``httpheaders.AcceptLanguage`` now won't give an exception when
  there is a malformed parameter in the header.

* Fix ``paste.auth.form.auth_form`` Paste Deploy entry point.

* Added REST methods to ``paste.fixture.TestApp``, so you can more
  easily do requests like PUT and DELETE.  From Anders Pearson.

* Added ``{{default var=default_value}}`` command to
  ``paste.util.template``.  Make ``{{# comment}}`` work.

1.3
---

* In ``paste.httpserver`` remove the reverse DNS lookup to set
  ``REMOTE_HOST``

* In ``paste.fileapp``, if the client sends both If-None-Match and
  If-Modified-Since, prefer If-None-Match.  Make ETags include the
  size as well as last modified timestamp.  Make it possible to
  override how mimetypes are guessed.

* ``HTTPException`` objects now have a ``exc.response(environ)``
  method that returns a ``WSGIResponse`` object.

* ``egg:Paste#watch_threads`` will show tracebacks of each thread
  under Python 2.5.

* Made ``paste.util.template`` trim whitespace around statements that
  are on their own line.

* ``paste.fileapp.DataApp`` now accepts ``allowed_headers=[...]`` to
  specify the allowed headers.  By default only ``GET`` and ``HEAD``
  are allowed.

* Added ``paste.util.import_string.try_import_module``, which imports
  modules and catches ``ImportError``, but only if it's an error
  importing the specific module, not an uncaught ``ImportError`` in
  the module being imported.

1.2.1
-----

* ``paste.httpserver`` didn't implement the ``readline`` that the
  ``cgi`` module wants (regression in 1.2).

1.2
---

* **Backward incompatible change**: ``paste.fileapp.FileApp`` properly
  supports request methods, including HEAD.  If you were subclassing
  ``FileApp`` or ``DataApp`` and overriding ``__call__()`` you may have
  to subclass ``get()`` instead.

* paste.httpheaders now parses the HTTP Accept-Language header and returns
  a list of languages the browser supports in the order it prefers them.

* paste.mimeparse module added that handles parsing HTTP Accept headers
  for quality and mime-types.

* ``paste.request.construct_url`` was adding ``SERVER_PORT`` to
  ``HTTP_HOST``; but ``HTTP_HOST`` (from the Host header) generally
  contains a port when necessary, and ``SERVER_PORT`` should only be
  used with ``SERVER_NAME``.

* Added entry point for ``paste.registry.RegistryManager``
  (``egg:Paste#registry``).

* ``paste.request.HeaderDict`` fixed to know that ``Content-Length``
  maps to ``CONTENT_LENGTH``.

* Can use ``paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser`` with sub-instances other
  than ``paste.fileapp.FileApp`` (if you subclass and override
  ``make_app``)

* ``paste.fixture.TestApp.get(status=X)`` takes a list of allowed
  status codes for ``X``.

* Added a small templating system for internal use (``paste.util.template``)

* Removed a bunch of long-deprecated modules (generally modules that
  have been moved to other names).

In paste.wsgiwrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIRequest`` has match_accept() function to screen
  incoming HTPT Accept values against a list of mime-types.

* ``paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIRequest.defaults`` now accepts a new key:

  ``language``:
    The i18n language that should be used as the fallback should
    a translation not occur in a language file. See docs for
    details.

* ``paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIRequest`` can now optionally decode form
  parameters to unicode when it has a ``charset`` value set.

* Deprecated the ``paste.wsgiwrappers.settings`` StackedObjectProxy
  dictionary for ``paste.wsgiwrappers.WSGIResponse.defaults``.

In paste.httpserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Regression in 1.1 fixed, where Paste's HTTP server would drop
  trailing slashes from paths.

* ``paste.httpserver`` now puts a key in the environment when using a
  thread pool that allows you to track the thread pool and see any
  wedged threads.  ``egg:Paste#watch_threads`` is an application that
  can display this information.

* ``paste.httpserver`` now accepts all request methods, not just
  ``GET``, ``PUT``, etc.  (Methods like ``MKCOL`` were previously
  rejected.)

* ``paste.httpserver`` has a ``wsgi.input`` that now does not block if
  you try to read past the end (it is limited to returning the number
  of bytes given in ``Content-Length``).  Double-reading from
  ``wsgi.input`` won't give you the same data, but it won't cause
  blocking.

1.1.1
-----

* Fixed major issue with serving static files on Windows (a regression
  in Paste 1.1 where most static files would return 404 Not Found).

* Fixed ``parse_dict_querystring`` returning empty dicts instead of
  ``MultiDict``\ s.

* Added ``paste.config``, a rewrite of ``paste.deploy.config`` using
  ``paste.registry``. This version of ``ConfigMiddleware`` will
  enable use of ``paste.config.CONFIG`` within the ``EvalException``
  interactive debugger.

* Fixed problem where ``paste.recursive`` would leave ``wsgi.input``
  and ``CONTENT_LENGTH`` set for recursive requests.

* Changed the static file servers to give 404 Not Found responses when
  you have extra parts after a static file, instead of 400 Bad
  Request (like when you request ``/file.html/extra/path``)

1.1
---

* Security fix for ``paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser``.  The problem
  allowed escaping the root (and reading files) when used with
  ``paste.httpserver`` (this does not effect other servers, and does
  not apply when proxying requests from Apache to
  ``paste.httpserver``).

* ``paste.httpserver`` and ``paste.fixture.TestApp`` url-unquote
  ``SCRIPT_NAME`` and ``PATH_INFO``, as specified in the CGI spec.
  Thanks to Jon Nelson for pointing out both these issues.

* ``paste.registry`` now works within the ``EvalException``
  interactive debugger.

* Fixed ``paste.auth.open_id`` failures not returning a correct
  response.

* Changed ``paste.httpexceptions.HTTPUnauthorized`` so that the
  ``WWW-Authenticate`` header is not required.  401 responses don't
  *have* to have that header.

* In ``paste.fixture.TestApp``: ``<form>`` tags that have to
  ``action`` will preserve the existing query string.  (Generally
  relative links that are completely empty should but were not
  preserving the query string)

* Made ``paste.*`` compatible with `py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org/>`_
  by adding a ``modulefinder`` call in ``__init__.py``

* The ``paste.gzipper`` gzipping middleware wasn't changing the
  Content-Length header properly; thanks to Brad Clements for the fix.

* Fixed ``paste.proxy`` to not use anything based on the dict form of
  ``httplib..HTTPMessage``.  This form folds headers together in a way
  that breaks ``Set-Cookie`` headers (two ``Set-Cookie`` headers would
  be merged into one).

* ``paste.request.parse_formvars`` didn't accept parameters in
  ``CONTENT_TYPE``.  ``prototype.js`` sets a ``charset`` parameter,
  which caused a problem.

* Added a ``__traceback_decorator__`` magic local variable, to allow
  arbitrary manipulation of the output of
  ``paste.exceptions.collector`` before formatting.

* Added unicorn power to ``paste.pony`` (from Chad Whitacre)

* For ``paste.httpserver`` SSL support: add support loading an
  explicit certificate context, and using ``ssl_pem='*'`` create an
  unsigned SSL certificate (from Jason Kirtland).

* Fix some cases where ``paste.httpserver`` can have an orphaned
  thread pool (causing the process to not shut down properly).  Patch
  from jek.

1.0
---

* Fixed ``parsed_formvars`` potentially locking up on wsgi.input
  after modification of ``QUERY_STRING``.

* Fixed problem where ``paste.exceptions.errormiddleware`` didn't
  expose the ``.close()`` method of the app_iter that it wraps (to
  catch exceptions).  This is a problem if the server about the
  errormiddleware aborts the request; it should then call
  ``.close()``, but won't necessarily exhaust the iterator to do so.

* Added entry point for ``paste.translogger``
  (``egg:Paste#translogger``)

* Fixed some cases where long data (e.g., a file upload) would show up
  in the error report, creating a very very large report.  Also, put
  in a monkeypatch for the ``cgi`` module so that
  ``repr(uploaded_field)`` won't load the entire field into memory
  (from its temporary file location).

* Added a ``force_host`` option to ``paste.proxy.TransparentProxy``,
  which will force all incoming requests to the same host, but leave
  the ``Host`` header intact.

* Added automatic cleanup of old sessions for ``paste.session``, from
  Amir Salihefendic.

* Quote the function name in tracebacks in the exception formatter;
  Genshi has function names that use ``<>``.

0.9.9
-----

* Fixed ``paste.response.HeaderDict`` ``get`` and ``setdefault``
  methods to be case insensitive

* Fix use of ``TestApp().post(params={'key': ['list of',
  'values']})`` as reported by Syver Enstad.

* ``paste.fileapp.DataApp`` is now directly usable (was previously
  only usable as an abstract base class).

0.9.8
-----

* Fixed ``wsgiwrappers.WSGIResponse.delete_cookie``. It also now takes
  optional path and domain arguments

* ``wsgiwrappers.WSGIResponse`` now handles generator/iterator content
  more cleanly, and properly encodes unicode content according to its
  specified charset

* Fixed ``wsgiwrappers.WSGIResponse`` mishandling multiple headers of
  the same name

* Added a Paste Deploy entry point for ``paste.auth.cookie``

* Moved Paste Deploy dependencies out of top-level modules and into
  Paste-Deploy-specific entry point functions.  This should make Paste
  more-or-less Paste Deploy independent.  ``paste.urlparser`` and
  ``paste.exceptions.errormiddleware`` still have some leftover bits.

* Added another redirector type to ``paste.recursive``,
  ``environ['paste.recursive.include_app_iter']`` which gives access
  to the original app_iter.

* Bug with ``wsgilib.catch_errors`` and app_iters with no ``close()``
  method.

* Long words in tracebacks weren't being wrapped correctly at all.
  Also, large data would cause the wrapping routine to give a
  recursion error.  Now large data is truncated (at 1000 characters),
  and recursion won't be a problem.  Also, wrapping shouldn't lose
  characters.

* Better exception if you try to put a non-str into environ when using
  ``paste.auth.cookie``

* ``paste.exceptions.collector`` produces an
  ``exc_data.exception_type`` that is a class, not a string.  This
  helps it get formatted better in Python 2.5.

* All the tests pass on Python 2.5!

* Added ``paste.proxy.TransparentProxy``, which just sends the request
  described in the WSGI environ on without any modification.  More
  useful for WSGI clients than servers, it effectively allows any
  WSGI-based request mechanism to act like an httplib-based request
  mechanism.

* Added a ``cache_max_age`` argument to
  ``paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser``, which allows you to encourage
  the caching of static files.  Patch from Brad Clements.

* Added ``suppress_http_headers`` to ``paste.proxy.Proxy``, which will
  filter out HTTP headers from the request before passing it on.
  Patch from Brad Clements.

0.9.7
-----

* The ``EvalException`` 'full traceback' button is now only displayed
  when the full traceback differs from the regular (includes hidden
  frames).

* Fixed ``EvalException`` returning a Content-type of 'text-html'
  instead of 'text/html' in some cases.

0.9.6
-----

* Renamed the ``paste.util.multidict.multidict`` class to
  ``paste.util.multidict.MultiDict``

0.9.5
-----

* Fixed a security vulnerability in ``paste.urlparser``'s StaticURLParser
  and PkgResourcesParser where, with some servers, you could escape
  the document root.

* Significantly improved ``paste.httpserver``'s (egg:Paste#http)
  performance. It now uses a thread pool: previously it created a new
  thread for every request. To revert back to the old, slower behavior,
  set::

    use_threadpool = false

  in the [server:main] section of the config file.

* More control of where the output of ``paste.debug.prints`` goes.

* Added a warning to ``paste.wsgilib.add_close`` if the upstream
  app_iter consumer doesn't call the ``app_iter.close()`` method.

* Fixed ``testapp.post(params={})``

* Fixed ``paste.translogger.TransLogger`` to log to the Apache combined
  log format as advertised.

* Fixed ``paste.urlparser`` classes to handle quoted characters (e.g.
  %20) in URL paths.

* Changed ``paste.session`` to allow manipulating a session for the
  first time after ``start_response`` is called.

* Added ``paste.wsgilib.add_start_close`` which calls a function just
  before returning the first chunk of the app_iter.

* Changed ``paste.urlmap`` so that it matches domain-specific mappings
  before domain-neutral mappings.

* Fixed IE 6 potentially receiving the following ``"400 Bad Request"``
  error on file downloads::

    Please check your system clock.
    According to this server, the time provided in the
    If-Modified-Since header is in the future.

* Added a 'no' keyword argument to ``TestResponse.mustcontain``, so
  you can assert that a response does contain some strings at the same
  time that you assert that a response *does not* contain other
  strings, like::

    res = app.get('/')
    res.mustcontain('this must be there',
                    no=['error', 'unexpected'])

* Fixed ``fileapp.FileApp`` to pay attention to the ``If-None-Match``
  header, which does ETag matching; before only ``If-Modified-Since``
  was supported, even though an ``ETag`` header was being sent; in
  particular Firefox would then only send ``If-None-Match`` and so
  conditional requests never worked.

* Changed usage of ``paste.request.MultiDict`` to
  ``paste.util.multidict``, particularly in ``paste.wsgiwrappers``
  where ``request.GET`` returns a new style of dictionary interface.

* Be more careful in ``paste.request.parse_formvars`` not to let
  the ``cgi`` module read from ``wsgi.input`` when there are no
  parsable variables in the input (based on ``CONTENT_TYPE``).

0.9.4
-----

* This released was lost in a tragic clerical accident.

0.9.3
-----

* 0.9.2 Included a version of MochiKit that was no longer compatible with
  evalexception; 0.9.3 reverts to a previous version.

* Change wsgi.run_once=False for ``paste.httpserver``

* Added entry points for debug apps

0.9.2
-----

* Fix in paste.urlmap when connecting with host:port.

* Added ``/_debug/summary`` to evalexception, which gives a
  JSON-formatted list of all the exceptions in memory.

0.9.1
-----

* A fix for paste.errordocument, when doing an internal redirect from
  a POST request (the request is rewritten as a GET request)

0.9
---

* Added `paste.request.WSGIRequest
  <class-paste.request.WSGIRequest.html>`_, a request object that
  wraps the WSGI environment.

* Added `paste.registry <module-paste.registry.html>`_, which is
  middleware for registering threadlocal objects in a request.

* Avoid annoying warning from paste.recursive

* ``paste.httpserver`` now removes HTTPServer's transaction logging,
  which was doing a reverse DNS lookup.

* Added ``has_session`` to ``paste.session``

* Allow for conditional ``paste.wsgilib.intercept_output`` which
  should be slightly faster (and streamable) compared to doing the
  condition manually.

* Added entry point for `paste.proxy <module-paste.proxy.html>`_, plus
  improvements from Brad Clements (support path in target, filter
  request methods)

* Added `paste.pony <module-paste.pony.html>`_ so pony power can be
  added to any WSGI application.

* Added port matching to ``paste.urlmap``.

0.5
---

* Added `paste.auth.auth_tkt <module-paste.auth.auth_tkt.html>`_

* Added `paste.auth.grantip <module-paste.auth.grantip.html>`_

0.4.1
-----

* Some bug fixes to the `built-in HTTP server
  <module-paste.httpserver.html>`_.

* Experimental `paste.progress <module-paste.progress.html>`_
  middleware for tracking upload progress

* Some tweaking of how `paste.reload <module-paste.reload.html>`_
  works, especially with respect to shutdown.

0.4
---

* Fixed up paste documentation (especially for new packages/modules)

* Added `paste.auth <module-paste.auth.html>`_ package for authentication
  related WSGI middle-ware components:

  - ``basic`` and ``digest`` HTTP authentication as described by RFC 2617

  - support for Yale's Central Authentication System (``cas``)

  - ``open_id`` supports single sign-on originally developed for
    LiveJournal (see http://openid.net)

  - ``cookie`` digitally signs cookies to record the current
    authenticated user (``REMOTE_USER``), session identifier
    (``REMOTE_SESSION``), and other WSGI entries in the ``environ``.

  - a ``form`` module (to be used with ``cookie`` or an equivalent)
    provides a simple HTML based form authentication.

  - the ``multi`` module is an *experimental* mechanism for choosing
    an authentication mechanism based on the WSGI ``environ``

* Added `paste.httpserver <module-paste.httpserver.html>`_ module which
  provides a very simple WSGI server built upon python's
  ``BaseHTTPServer``; this server has support for several features:

  - support for SSL connections via OpenSSL

  - support for HTTP/1.1 ``100 Continue`` messages as required by the
    WSGI specification (many HTTP server implementations don't do this)

  - implemented as a Mix-In so that it can be used with other
    more enchanted versions of ``BaseHTTPServer``

  - support for 'Keep-Alive' (standard in HTTP/1.1) by either providing
    a content-length or closing a connection if one is not available

* Improved the `paste.httpexceptions <module-paste.httpexceptions.html>`_
  module:

  - added missing exception objects, and better descriptions

  - fixed several bugs in how exceptions are caught and propagated

  - usage as a ``wsgi_application()`` enables exceptions to be
    returned without throwing or catching the error

  - support for plain/text messages for text-only clients such as
    curl, python's urllib, or Microsoft Excel

  - allows customization of the HTML template for higher-level frameworks

* Added `paste.httpheaders <module-paste.httpheaders.html>`_ module
  to provide a uniform mechanism to access/update standard HTTP headers
  in a WSGI ``environ`` and ``response_headers`` collection; it includes
  specific support for:

  - providing "common" header names and sorting them as suggested
    by RFC 2616

  - validated support for ``Cache-Control`` header construction

  - validated support for ``Content-Disposition`` header construction

  - parsing of ``If-Modified-Since`` and other date oriented headers

  - parsing of Range header for partial-content delivery

  - composition of HTTP/1.1 digest ``Authorization`` responses

* Improved `paste.fileapp <module-paste.fileapp.html>`_ to support:

  - static in-memory resources

  - incremental downloading of files from disk

  - responding to 'Range' requests to handle partial downloads

  - allowing cache settings to be easily provided; including
    support for HTTP/1.0 'Expires' and HTTP/1.1 'Cache-Control'

* Added an *experimental* `paste.transaction
  <module-paste.transaction.html>`_ module for handling
  commit/rollback of standard DBAPI database connections

* Added a `paste.util.datetimeutil <module-paste.util.datetimeutil.html>`_
  module for parsing standard date/time user-generated text values

* Added a `debug <module-paste.debug.html>`_ package, which includes:

  - previous top-level modules ``prints``, ``profile``,
    ``wdg_validate`` and ``doctest_webapp``

  - a ``testserver`` module suitable to test HTTP socket
    connections via ``py.test``

* Re-factored `paste.wsgilib <module-paste.wsgilib.html>`_ into
  several other modules:

  - functions regarding header manipulation moved to
    `paste.response <module-paste.response.html>`_

  - functions regarding cookies and arguments moved to
    `paste.request <module-paste.request.html>`_

* Significant improvements to ``wsgiutils.wsgilib`` module:

  - added a ``dump_environ`` application to help debugging

  - fixes to ``raw_interactive`` to comply with WSGI specifications

  - ``raw_interactive`` now logs all 5xx exceptions and sets HTTP_HOST

* Added an argument ``no_profile`` to
  `paste.debug.profile.profile_decorator
  <module-paste.debug.profile.html#profile_decorator>`_; if that
  option is false, then don't profile the function at all.

* Changed `paste.lint <module-paste.lint.html>`_ to check that the
  status contains a message (e.g., ``"404 Not Found"`` instead of just
  ``"404"``).  Check that environmental variables
  ``HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE`` and ``HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH`` are no present.
  Made unknown ``REQUEST_METHOD`` a warning (not an error).

* Added parameter ``cwd`` to `TestFileEnvironment.run
  <class-paste.fixture.TestFileEnvironment.html#run>`_

* `paste.fixture.TestApp <class-paste.fixture.TestApp.html>`_:

  - Form filling code (use ``response.forms[0]`` to get a `form object
    <class-paste.fixture.Form.html>`_)

  - Added `click method
    <class-paste.fixture.TestResponse.html#click>`_.

  - Better attribute errors.

  - You can force set hidden fields using
    ``form.fields[name].force_value(value)`` (normally setting the
    value of a hidden field is an error).

  - Frameworks can now add custom attributes to the response object.

* ``paste.wsgilib.capture_output`` is deprecated in favor of
  `paste.wsgilib.intercept_output
  <module-paste.wsgilib.html#intercept_output>`_

* Remove use of exceptions in `paste.cascade.Cascade
  <class-paste.cascade.Cascade.html>`_, which causes weird effects in
  some cases.  Generally we aren't using exceptions internally now,
  only return status codes.  Also in cascade, be careful to keep
  cascaded requests from sharing the same environment.

* ``paste.wsgilib.error_response`` is deprecated
  (`paste.httpexceptions <module-paste.httpexceptions.html>`_ replaces
  this with exception's ``.wsgi_application`` method).

* Moved ``paste.login`` to the attic, since `paste.auth
  <module-paste.auth.html>`_ pretty much replaces it.

* `paste.urlparser <module-paste.urlparser.html>`_ improvements:

  - Added an application `urlparser.StaticURLParser
    <class-paste.urlparser.StaticURLParser.html>`_ for serving static
    files.

  - Added an application `urlparser.PkgResourcesParser
    <class-paste.urlparser.PkgResourcesParser.html>`_ for serving static
    files found with ``pkg_resources`` (e.g., out of zipped Eggs).

  - Be less picky about ambiguous filenames when using `URLParser
    <class-paste.urlparser.URLParser.html>`_; if an exact file match
    exists, use that.  (``file.gif.bak`` would cause a request for
    ``file.gif`` to be ambiguous before)

  - Now looks for a ``.wsgi_application`` attribute when serving
    Python files/modules, as a general hook for returning a WSGI
    application version of an object.

* The `ErrorMiddleware
  <class-paste.exceptions.errormiddleware.ErrorMiddleware.html>`_:

  - Returns trimmed-down exceptions if there is a ``_`` GET variable
    in the request (which is meant to signal an XMLHttpRequest).
    Exceptions displayed in this context are best when they are smaller
    and easier to display.

  - Includes a text version of the traceback, for easier
    copy-and-paste.

  - Avoid printing exceptions to ``wsgi.errors`` if they are already
    displayed elsewhere (at least by default).

  - Highlight Python code.

* Use ``pkg_resources.declare_namespace`` so that there are less
  problems about confusing the ``paste`` package that is provided by
  Paste, Paste Script, Paste Deploy, and Paste WebKit.  Before you
  could get one of these at random if you didn't use
  ``pkg_resources.require`` first.

* Cleaned up use of ``exc_info`` argument in ``start_response`` calls
  (both accepting and producing), in a variety of places.
