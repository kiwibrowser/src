/**
 * Material design: [Text fields](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html)
 *
 * `<paper-input>` is a single-line text field with Material Design styling.
 *
 *     <paper-input label="Input label"></paper-input>
 *
 * It may include an optional error message or character counter.
 *
 *     <paper-input error-message="Invalid input!" label="Input label"></paper-input>
 *     <paper-input char-counter label="Input label"></paper-input>
 *
 * It can also include custom prefix or suffix elements, which are displayed
 * before or after the text input itself. In order for an element to be
 * considered as a prefix, it must have the `prefix` attribute (and similarly
 * for `suffix`).
 *
 *     <paper-input label="total">
 *       <div prefix>$</div>
 *       <paper-icon-button slot="suffix" icon="clear"></paper-icon-button>
 *     </paper-input>
 *
 * A `paper-input` can use the native `type=search` or `type=file` features.
 * However, since we can't control the native styling of the input (search icon,
 * file button, date placeholder, etc.), in these cases the label will be
 * automatically floated. The `placeholder` attribute can still be used for
 * additional informational text.
 *
 *     <paper-input label="search!" type="search"
 *         placeholder="search for cats" autosave="test" results="5">
 *     </paper-input>
 *
 * See `Polymer.PaperInputBehavior` for more API docs.
 *
 * ### Focus
 *
 * To focus a paper-input, you can call the native `focus()` method as long as the
 * paper input has a tab index. Similarly, `blur()` will blur the element.
 *
 * ### Styling
 *
 * See `Polymer.PaperInputContainer` for a list of custom properties used to
 * style this element.
 *
 * The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
 *
 * Custom property | Description | Default
 * ----------------|-------------|----------
 * `--paper-input-container-ms-clear` | Mixin applied to the Internet Explorer reveal button (the eyeball) | {}
