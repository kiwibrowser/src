Use a pool of workers to concurrently process a sequence of items.

Example usage:

    from soundwave import worker_pool

    def MyWorker(args):
      # This is called once for each worker to initialize it.

      def Process(item):
        # This will be called once for each item processed by this worker.

      # Hook up the Process function so the worker_pool module can find it.
      worker_pool.Process = Process

    args.processes = 10  # Set number of processes to be used by the pool.
    worker_pool.Run('This might take a while: ', MyWorker, args, items)
