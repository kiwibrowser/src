# Datastore Composite Index Configuration.
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/indexconfig
#
# Below, most indexes come in pairs; one with the internal_only property,
# one without. This is because all queries when the user is not logged in
# have the filter internal_only == False.
#
# Composite index properties must be listed differently depending on how the
# properties are used. There are three main ways to use properties in a query:
#   (1) In an equality filter.
#   (2) In an inequality filter.
#   (3) In a sort order.
# The properties below must be listed in this order. The "direction" only needs
# to be specified for properties used for sort order.
#
# To update the indexes in production after editing them here, you must run
# appcfg.py vacuum_indexes or appcfg.py update_indexes.
