"""An example of using perf dashboard API with your own user account.

Getting set up:
1. Install httplib2and oauth2client python modules:
`pip install httplib2`
`pip install oauth2client`

This example is very bare-bones, but should allow you to use the API with
minimal setup and no service account credentials. For more details on how to
write API-using code with OAuth2, see:
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp
https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/installed-app
For a more complete working example, see the depot_tools auth code:
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/tools/depot_tools/auth.py
