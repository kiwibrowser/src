# Pinpoint: Regression Explorer

[**Pinpoint**](https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/) is a Python App Engine service for analyzing regressions.

Given a metric and commit range, it can narrow down a regression to a specific commit. It's designed to gracefully handle a variety of tough situations:
* Noisy performance metrics.
* Metrics that require "device affinity" (i.e. they may produce different numbers on different devices).
* Flaky and failing tests.
* Multiple regressions and improvements.
* Commit ranges with thousands of commits.
* Regressions in dependent repositories.

It also provides a UI for visualizing the raw result data and digging into the root causes.
Users can adjust the parameters and test potential fixes.
