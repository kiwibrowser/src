# Chrome Custom Tabs - Examples and Documentation

Chrome Custom Tabs provides a way for an application to customize and interact
with a Chrome `Activity` on Android. This makes the web content feel like being
a part of the application, while retaining the full functionality and
performance of a complete web browser.

## Examples

[Using Custom
Tabs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/custom-tabs-client/+/master/Using.md)
should be easy. This repository hosts examples and in-depth documentation. The
examples are importable as projects into the Android Studio.

Please use the template for any issues related to the Custom Tabs APIs, their
implementation in Chrome, the examples in this repository, and related
functionality of the Android Support Library.

Note: we know that the GitHub issue tracker is great! However, since Custom Tabs
is mostly driven by Chrome developers, and we want to keep all bugs in one
place, we prefer the Chromium issue tracker at the moment.
