NAME

git-footers -

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git footers' [--key FOOTER] REF
'git footers' [--position | --position-ref | --position-num] REF

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`git footers` extracts information included in commit messages as "footers",
which are roughly like HTTP headers except they are at the end.  For example, a
commit might look like:

    This is a fancy commit message.

    Cr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#292272}
    Tech-Debt-Introduced: 17 nanoMSOffices

`git footers` knows how to extract this information.

Footers are order-independent and can appear more than once. Thus they are
treated as a multimap.

OPTIONS
-------

If no options are given, all footers are printed, with their names
case-normalized.

--key FOOTER::
  Extract all the headers associated with the given key, and print one per 
  line. If there are no footers with this key, produces no output and exits
  successfully.

--position::
  Extract the Chrome commit position from the footers.  This first attempts
  to get the value of the `Cr-Commit-Position` footer.  If that doesn't exist
  then it tries a heuristic based on `Git-Svn-Id`.  Output is in one of the
  following forms:

    refs/heads/master@{#292272}
    refs/branch-heads/branchname

--position-num::
  Extracts and prints the Chrome commit position number only (292272 in the
  example above).  Exits with an error if one cannot be found.

--position-ref::
  Extracts and prints the Chrome commit position ref name only 
  (`ref/heads/master` or `refs/branch-heads/branchname` in the example above).
