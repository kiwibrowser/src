git-reparent-branch -

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git reparent-branch' <new_parent>
'git reparent-branch' --lkgr
'git reparent-branch' --root

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Change the 'upstream' of the current branch, and then run
linkgit:git-rebase-update[1] to move the commits in the current branch, as well
as the commits in all descendant branches, onto the new parent.

`<new_parent>` may be either a local branch, remote branch, OR a tag (such as
`lkgr`).

This is particularly useful to reparent an independent CL to become dependent on
another CL, or vice versa. This could happen if you started both on the
assumption that they were independent, but later realized that this was not the
case.


OPTIONS
-------

<new_parent>::
  The new parent to set as the upstream for this branch. May be a branch ref or
  a tag.

--lkgr::
  Reparent to track lkgr.

--root::
  Reparent to track the 'root' branch. Defaults to 'origin/master'. See
  linkgit:git-new-branch[1]'s CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section..
