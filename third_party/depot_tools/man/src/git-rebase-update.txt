SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git rebase-update' [-v | --verbose] [-n | --no-fetch] [-k | --keep-going]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Brings all branches up-to-date with their tracking branches. This involves
several phases:

Preparation::
  If you currently have a branch checked out, any changes on that branch are
  'frozen' (See linkgit:git-freeze[1] for more detail). Additionally, the current
  branch is recorded for the 'Restoration' phase later (see 'CONFIGURATION
  VARIABLES' for details on `depot-tools.rebase-update.starting-branch`).

Fetching::
  All branches are examined to find their upstream references. The correct set
  of git remotes is determined, and fetched accordingly. Note that if any
  branches have a tag as their upstream, we are forced to pull all remotes.
+
Pass `--no-fetch` to skip this phase.

Rebasing::
  All branches are rebased in topological order from roots (upstreams) to
  leaves.  Each branch is rebased from its marked merge-base (see 'CONFIGURATION
  VARIABLES') to the branch tip on top of its parent branch. If the parent
  branch is 'frozen' (see linkgit:git-freeze[1]), the branch will be rebased
  onto the last non-freeze commit on the parent branch.
+
Things get interesting when there are merge conflicts on rebase. The *most
common* cause for conflicts is when your branch has been committed to the
upstream in squashed form, ala linkgit:git-squash-branch[1], which is what
linkgit:git-cl[1] and the 'Commit Queue' will do. Because of that, `git
rebase-update` will attempt to squash your conflicted branch to see if the
squashed version applies cleanly to its upstream.
+
If it does not apply cleanly, then your original (non-squashed) branch will be
left in mid-rebase and `git rebase-update` will exit. You can deal with this
like any other conflicted rebase. When you're done, just `git rebase-update`
again to pick up where you left off.

If you'd like to rebase all rebaseable branches in one pass and manually process
the unrebaseable ones later, use -k or --keep-going. Cleanup will not happen
until all branches apply cleanly.

Cleanup::
  Once all the branches have been rebased, any empty branches (i.e. branches
  with no commits on them) are removed. If a branch is removed in this fashion,
  any branches which depend on it are reparented to the parent of the removed
  branch (see linkgit:git-reparent-branch[1]).

Restoration::
  `git rebase-update` checks out the branch that you started on, and 'thaws' it,
  if necessary (see linkgit:git-thaw[1]). If the branch you started on got
  cleaned up, `git rebase-update` will checkout the 'root' ref (defaults to
  'origin/master', as configured by `depot-tools.upstream`, see
  linkgit:git-new-branch[1]).


OPTIONS
-------

-n::
--no-fetch::
  Skip the `git fetch` phase of rebase-update.

-v::
--verbose::
  More text than your terminal can handle.


CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------

depot-tools.rebase-update.starting-branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When `git rebase-update` first runs, it will record the current branch here so
that when it completes successfully, it will return back to the same branch you
started on, even if `git rebase-update` is interrupted due to rebase conflicts.
When `git rebase-update` completes successfully, this configuration variable is
removed.

branch.<name>.dormant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If `true`, will cause rebase-update to skip all processing on the branch.
Useful for old/high-conflict branches which you want to keep for posterity, but
don't want to deal with when running `git rebase-update`

branch.<name>.base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds the 'base' reference for this branch. By default this is equivalent to
`git merge-base <name> <name>@{upstream}`. However, it can diverge if
`<name>@{upstream}` is manually rebased. In this case, it correctly preserves
the value it had before, where `git merge-base` would now report the wrong
value.

All of the tools in the linkgit:depot_tools[1] suite collude to keep this value
as up-to-date as possible, including linkgit:git-reparent-branch[1], and
linkgit:git-new-branch[1]. linkgit:git-map[1] also shows the location of these
marker values in [black-background white]**white**.

linkgit:git-mark-merge-base[1] allows easy manual interaction for this value,
in the unlikely event that it gets out of sync.
