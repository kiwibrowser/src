Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the binutils tools
(including gold linker).

They were built from binutils-2.29.1 using the "build-all.sh" script on Debian
Testing.

The script creates chroots for 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu Xenial and then builds
binutils inside the roots.

Local patches:

 * (build-all.sh|build-one.sh|upload.sh) scripts for building the binutils
   binaries and uploading them to Google storage.

Upgrading:

To upgrade binutils, use the following steps:

 * Update build-all.sh with the new binutil version.
 * Remove any patches which have been merged upstream from build-all.sh
 * Update this README.chromium file
 * Run build-all.sh
 * Run upload.sh. Note: you will need write access to
   gs://chromium-binutils bucket on Google Cloud Storage. To get the
   access, subscribe to the internal chrome-team mailing list.
 * Wait for goma to have new binutils deployed (see http://go/ma).
    Please notify {ukai,yyanagisawa,shinyak}@chromium.org and await
    confirmation.
 * Commit the change
