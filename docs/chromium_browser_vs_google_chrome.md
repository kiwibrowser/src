# The Difference between Google Chrome and Chromium on Linux

Chromium on Linux has two general flavors: You can either get
[Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome?platform=linux) or chromium-browser
(see [Linux Chromium Packages](linux_chromium_packages.md).
This page tries to describe the differences between the two.

In short, Google Chrome is the Chromium open source project built, packaged, and
distributed by Google. This table lists what Google adds to the Google Chrome
builds **on Linux**.

## Google Chrome

    Please include symbolized backtraces in bug reports if you don't have crash
    reporting turned on.

*   Video and Audio codecs (may vary by distro)
    *   AAC, H.264, MP3, Opus, Theora, Vorbis, VP8, VP9, and WAV

*   Code is tested by Chrome developers
*   Sandbox is always on
*   Single deb/rpm package
