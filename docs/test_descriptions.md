|[browser\_tests](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/browser-tests)|Tests the browser UI. Can not inject user input or depend on focus/activation behavior because it can be run in parallel processes and/or with a locked screen, headless etc. For tests sensitive to that, use interactive\_ui\_tests. For example, when tests need to navigate to chrome://hang (see chrome/browser/ui/webui/ntp/new\_tab\_ui\_uitest.cc)|

|content\_browsertests   |Similar to browser\_tests, but with a minimal shell contained entirely within content/. This test, as well as the entire content module, has no dependencies on chrome/.|

|interactive\_ui\_tests  |Like browser\_tests, but these tests do things like changing window focus, so that the machine running the test can't be used while the test is running. May include browsertests (derived from InProcessBrowserTest) to run in-process in case when the test is sensitive to focus transitions or injects user input/mouse events.|
