# Chrome is slow, what do I do?

## How to file a bug

  * **File a bug.** To file a bug, please use
**[the speed bug template](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Speed%20Bug)**.
  * **Attach a trace.** The best way to get performance data to developers is to include a trace,
    so please [follow these instructions](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/recording-tracing-runs)
    to record a trace and attach it to the bug.
  * **Try TraceOnTap** the [TraceOnTap Extension](http://goto.google.com/traceontap)
    makes it easier to record traces and attach them to bugs.
