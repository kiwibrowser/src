// A byte stream is a pipe to transfer bytes between a source and a
// sink, which may be on different threads.  It is intended to be the
// only connection between source and sink; they need have no
// direct awareness of each other aside from the byte stream.  The source and
// the sink have different interfaces to a byte stream, |ByteStreamWriter|
// and |ByteStreamReader|.  A pair of connected interfaces is generated by
// calling |CreateByteStream|.
//
// The source adds bytes to the bytestream via |ByteStreamWriter::Write|
// and the sink retrieves bytes already written via |ByteStreamReader::Read|.
//
// When the source has no more data to add, it will call
// |ByteStreamWriter::Close| to indicate that.  Operation status at the source
// is indicated to the sink via an int passed to the Close() method and returned
// from the GetStatus() method. Source and sink must agree on the interpretation
// of this int.
//
// Normally the source is not managed after the relationship is setup;
// it is expected to provide data and then close itself.  If an error
// occurs on the sink, it is not signalled to the source via this
// mechanism; instead, the source will write data until it exausts the
// available space.  If the source needs to be aware of errors occuring
// on the sink, this must be signalled in some other fashion (usually
// through whatever controller setup the relationship).
//
// Callback lifetime management: No lifetime management is done in this
// class to prevent registered callbacks from being called after any
// objects to which they may refer have been destroyed.  It is the
// responsibility of the callers to avoid use-after-free references.
// This may be done by any of several mechanisms, including weak
// pointers, scoped_refptr references, or calling the registration
// function with a null callback from a destructor.  To enable the null
// callback strategy, callbacks will not be stored between retrieval and
// evaluation, so setting a null callback will guarantee that the
// previous callback will not be executed after setting.
//
// Class methods are virtual to allow mocking for tests; these classes
// aren't intended to be base classes for other classes.
//
// Sample usage (note that this does not show callback usage):
//
//    void OriginatingClass::Initialize() {
//      // Create a stream for sending bytes from IO->FILE threads.
