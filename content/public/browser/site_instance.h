///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// SiteInstance interface.
//
// A SiteInstance represents a group of web pages that must live in the same
// renderer process.  Pages able to synchronously script each other will always
// be placed in the same SiteInstance.  Pages unable to synchronously script
// each other may also be placed in the same SiteInstance, as determined by the
// process model.
//
// A page's SiteInstance is determined by a combination of where the page comes
// from (the site) and which frames have references to each other (the
// instance).  Here, a "site" is similar to the page's origin but includes only
// the registered domain name and scheme, not the port or subdomains.  This
// accounts for the fact that changes to document.domain allow similar origin
// pages with different ports or subdomains to script each other.  An "instance"
// includes all frames that might be able to script each other because of how
// they were created (e.g., window.open or targeted links).  We represent
// instances using the BrowsingInstance class.
//
// Four process models are currently supported:
//
// PROCESS PER SITE INSTANCE (the current default): SiteInstances are created
// (1) when the user manually creates a new tab (which also creates a new
// BrowsingInstance), and (2) when the user navigates across site boundaries
// (which uses the same BrowsingInstance).  If the user navigates within a site,
// the same SiteInstance is used.  Caveat: we currently allow renderer-initiated
// cross-site navigations to stay in the same SiteInstance, to preserve
// compatibility in cases like cross-site iframes that open popups.  This means
// that most SiteInstances will contain pages from multiple sites.
//
// SITE PER PROCESS (currently experimental): is the most granular process
// model and is made possible by our support for out-of-process iframes.  A
// subframe will be given a different SiteInstance if its site differs from the
// containing document.  Cross-site navigation of top-level frames or subframes
// will trigger a change of SiteInstances, even if the navigation is renderer
// initiated.  In this model, each process can be dedicated to documents from
// just one site, allowing the same origin policy to be enforced by the sandbox.
//
// PROCESS PER TAB: SiteInstances are created when the user manually creates a
// new tab, but not when navigating across site boundaries (unless a process
// swap is required for security reasons, such as navigating from a privileged
// WebUI page to a normal web page).  This corresponds to one process per
// BrowsingInstance.
//
// PROCESS PER SITE: We consolidate all SiteInstances for a given site into the
// same process, throughout the entire browser context.  This ensures that only
// one process will be used for each site.  Note that there is no strict process
// isolation of sites in this mode, so a given SiteInstance can still contain
// pages from multiple sites.
//
// Each NavigationEntry for a WebContents points to the SiteInstance that
// rendered it.  Each RenderFrameHost also points to the SiteInstance that it is
// associated with.  A SiteInstance keeps track of the number of these
// references and deletes itself when the count goes to zero.  This means that
// a SiteInstance is only live as long as it is accessible, either from new
// tabs with no NavigationEntries or in NavigationEntries in the history.
