 * This is a workaround for LG Email app: https://crbug.com/651706
 * LG Email app runs UI-thread APIs from InputConnection methods. This is not allowable with
 * the change ImeThread introduces, and LG Email app is bundled and cannot be updated without
 * a system update. However, LG Email team is committed to fixing this in the near future.
 * This is a version code limited workaround to avoid crashes in the app.
