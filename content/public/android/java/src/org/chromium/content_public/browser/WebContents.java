/**
 * The WebContents Java wrapper to allow communicating with the native WebContents object.
 *
 * Note about serialization and {@link Parcelable}:
 *   This object is serializable and deserializable as long as it is done in the same process.  That
 * means it can be passed between Activities inside this process, but not preserved beyond the
 * process lifetime.  This class will automatically deserialize into {@code null} if a deserialize
 * attempt happens in another process.
 *
 * To properly deserialize a custom Parcelable the right class loader must be used.  See below for
 * some examples.
 *
 * Intent Serialization/Deserialization Example:
 * intent.putExtra("WEBCONTENTSKEY", webContents);
 * // ... send to other location ...
 * intent.setExtrasClassLoader(WebContents.class.getClassLoader());
 * webContents = intent.getParcelableExtra("WEBCONTENTSKEY");
 *
 * Bundle Serialization/Deserialization Example:
 * bundle.putParcelable("WEBCONTENTSKEY", webContents);
 * // ... send to other location ...
 * bundle.setClassLoader(WebContents.class.getClassLoader());
 * webContents = bundle.get("WEBCONTENTSKEY");
