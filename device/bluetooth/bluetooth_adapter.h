  // Internal methods for initiating and terminating device discovery sessions.
  // An implementation of BluetoothAdapter keeps an internal reference count to
  // make sure that the underlying controller is constantly searching for nearby
  // devices and retrieving information from them as long as there are clients
  // who have requested discovery. These methods behave in the following way:
  //
  // On a call to AddDiscoverySession:
  //    - If there is a pending request to the subsystem, queue this request to
  //      execute once the pending requests are done.
  //    - If the count is 0, issue a request to the subsystem to start
  //      device discovery. On success, increment the count to 1.
  //    - If the count is greater than 0, increment the count and return
  //      success.
  //    As long as the count is non-zero, the underlying controller will be
  //    discovering for devices. This means that Chrome will restart device
  //    scan and inquiry sessions if they ever end, unless these sessions
  //    terminate due to an unexpected reason.
  //
  // On a call to RemoveDiscoverySession:
  //    - If there is a pending request to the subsystem, queue this request to
  //      execute once the pending requests are done.
  //    - If the count is 0, return failure, as there is no active discovery
  //      session.
  //    - If the count is 1, issue a request to the subsystem to stop device
  //      discovery and decrement the count to 0 on success.
  //    - If the count is greater than 1, decrement the count and return
  //      success.
  //

  // is owned by other objects and shall not be freed.  When the count is
  // greater than 0 and AddDiscoverySession or RemoveDiscoverySession is called
