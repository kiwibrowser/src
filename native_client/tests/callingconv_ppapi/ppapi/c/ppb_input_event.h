   * It's recommended that you use RequestFilteringInputEvents() for keyboard
   * events instead of this function so that you don't interfere with normal
   * browser accelerators.
   *
   * By default, no input events are delivered. Call this function with the

   * the instance. Calling this function will override any previous setting for
   * each specified class of input events (for example, if you previously
   * called RequestFilteringInputEvents(), this function will set those events
   * to non-filtering mode).
   *
   * Input events may have high overhead, so you should only request input
   * events that your plugin will actually handle. For example, the browser may
   * do optimizations for scroll or touch events that can be processed
   * substantially faster if it knows there are no non-default receivers for
   * that message. Requesting that such messages be delivered, even if they are
   * processed very quickly, may have a noticeable effect on the performance of
   * the page.

   * delivered and <i>not</i> bubbled to the page. This means that even if you
   * aren't interested in the message, no other parts of the page will get
   * a crack at the message.
   *
   * <strong>Example:</strong>
   * <code>
   *   RequestInputEvents(instance, PP_INPUTEVENT_CLASS_MOUSE);
   *   RequestFilteringInputEvents(instance,
   *       PP_INPUTEVENT_CLASS_WHEEL | PP_INPUTEVENT_CLASS_KEYBOARD);

   *
   * @param event_classes A combination of flags from
   * <code>PP_InputEvent_Class</code> that identifies the classes of events the
   * instance is requesting. The flags are combined by logically ORing their
   * values.
   *
   * @return <code>PP_OK</code> if the operation succeeded,
   * <code>PP_ERROR_BADARGUMENT</code> if instance is invalid, or
