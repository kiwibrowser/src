# Open Network Configuration

[TOC]

## Objective

We would like to create a simple, open, but complete format to describe
multiple network configurations for WiFi, Ethernet, Cellular,
Bluetooth/WiFi-Direct, and VPN connections in a single file format, in order
to simplify and automate network configuration for users.

## Background

Configuring networks is a painful and error-prone experience for users. It
is a problem shared across desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone users of all
operating system types. It is exacerbated in business and schools which
often have complex network configurations (VPNs and 802.1X networking) that
change often and have many connected devices. Configuration of WiFi is
still done manually, often by administrators physically standing next to
users working on devices. Certificate distribution is particularly painful
which often results in admins instead using passphrases to protect networks
or using protocols without client certificates that instead use LDAP
passwords for authentication. Even after networks are configured, updates to
the network configuration require another round of manual changes, and
accidental changes by a user or malicious changes by an attacker can break
connectivity or make connections less private or secure.

## Overview

We propose a single-file format for network configuration that is
human-readable, can describe all of the common kinds of network
configurations, supports integrity checking, certificate and key
provisioning, and updating. The file can be encrypted with a single
passphrase so that upon entering the passphrase the entire configuration is
loaded. The format can be described as an open format to enable multiple OS
vendors to interoperate and share configuration editors.

This format neither supports configuring browser settings nor allows setting
other types of system policies.

## Infrastructure

A standalone configuration editor will be created, downloadable as a Chrome
app. This editor will allow creating, modifying, and encrypting an open
network configuration file in a way that is intuitive for a system
administrator.

This file format may be delivered to a user and manually imported into a
device.

This file format may be created by an administrator, stored in a policy
repository, and automatically pushed to a device.

## Detailed Design

We use JSON format for the files. The fields in a JSON file are always
case-sensitive, so the exact case of the fields in this section must be
matched. In addition, the values that are called out as explicit constants
must also match the case specified (e.g. WiFi must not be written as wifi,
etc.). This document describes a minimum set of required fields and optional
fields. Other fields may be created, however, see the
implementation-specific fields for guidelines for these fields.

The JSON consists of a top level dictionary containing
a `Type` field which must have either the value
[EncryptedConfiguration](#EncryptedConfiguration-type) or
[UnencryptedConfiguration](#UnencryptedConfiguration-type).

For a description of the [EncryptedConfiguration](#EncryptedConfiguration-type)
type, see the section on [Encrypted Configuration](#Encrypted-Configuration)
below.
The [EncryptedConfiguration](#Encrypted-Configuration) format encrypts
an unencrypted JSON object.

## GUIDs and Updating

This format allows for importing updated network configurations and
certificates by providing GUIDs to each network configuration and
certificate so they can be modified or even removed in future updates.

GUIDs are non-empty strings that are meant to be stable and unique. When
they refer to the same entity, they should be the same between ONC files. No
two different networks or certificates should have the same GUID, similarly
a network and certificate should not have the same GUID. A single ONC file
should not contain the same entity twice (with the same GUID). Failing any
of these tests indicates the ONC file is not valid.

Any GUID referred to in an ONC file must be present in the same ONC file. In
particular, it is an error to create a certificate in one ONC file and refer
to it in a NetworkConfiguration in another ONC file and not define it there,
even if the previous ONC file has been imported.

## Implementation-specific fields

As there are many different kinds of connections and some that are not yet
anticipated may require new fields. This format allows arbitrary other
fields to be added.

Fields and values should follow these general guidelines:

* Certificates (with and without keys) should always be placed in the
  certificate section - specifically certificate contents should not be
  placed in fields directly. Referring to certificates should be done using
  a field whose name ends in Ref and whose value is the GUID of the
  certificate, or if the certificate is not contained in this file, its
  pattern can be described using a field ending in Pattern of
  [CertificatePattern](#CertificatePattern-type) type.
* Fields should exist in the most-specific object in the hierarchy and
  should be named CamelCase style.
* Booleans and integers should be used directly instead of using a
  stringified version of the type.

Any editor of network configuration information should allows the user to
modify any fields that are implementation-specific. It may not be present
directly in the UI but it should be able to import files with such settings
and leave preserve these settings on export.

## Unencrypted Configuration

When the top level **Type** field
is *UnencryptedConfiguration*, the top level JSON
has the [UnencryptedConfiguration](#UnencryptedConfiguration-type) type.

DHCP (see **SavedIPConfig**) and to configure a
static IP configuration (see **StaticIPConfig**).

### IPConfig type

* **Type**
    * (required) - **string**
    * Allowed values are:

      whose traffic should be handled by the network. Example:
      `["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.5.0/24"]`. If **IncludedRoutes** or
      **ExcludedRoutes** are not specified, this network
      will be used to handle traffic for all IPs by default. Currently this
      property only has an effect if the Network **Type** is *VPN* and the
      VPN **Type** is *ARCVPN*.

* **ExcludedRoutes**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * An array of strings, each of which is an IP block in CIDR notation,
      whose traffic should **not** be handled by the network. Example:
      `["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.5.0/24"]`. Currently this
      only has an effect if the Network **Type** is *VPN* and the VPN
      **Type** is *ARCVPN*.

    * Indicaties if ARP polling of default gateway is allowed.
      When it is allowed, periodic ARP messages will be sent to
      the default gateway. This is used for monitoring the status
      of the current connection.

    * Indicating that the network should be connected to automatically when in
      range.

    * The roam threshold for this network, which is the signal-to-noise value
      (in dB) below which we will attempt to roam to a new network. If this
      value is not set, the default value will be used.

* **Security**
    * (required) - **string**

    * (optional if **HexSSID** is set, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * Property to access the decoded SSID of a network.<br/>
      If this field is set, but **HexSSID** is not,
      its value will be UTF-8 encoded and the hex representation will be
      assigned to **HexSSID**. To configure a non-UTF-8
      SSID, field **HexSSID** must be used.<br/>
      When reading the configuration of a network, both this field and
      **HexSSID** might be set. Then this field is the
      decoding of **HexSSID**. If possible the HexSSID is
      decoded using UTF-8, otherwise an encoding is guessed on a best effort
      basis.

* **SignalStrength**
    * (optional, read-only) - **integer**
    * The current signal strength for this network in the range [0, 100],
      provided by the system. If the network is not in range this field will

  * At least one of the fields **HexSSID** or **SSID** must be present.
  * If both **HexSSID** and **SSID** are set, the values must be consistent.
---

## VPN networks

offer standard configuration options for a few common configurations at this
time, and may add more later. For all others, implementation specific fields
should be used.

      same as L2TP over IPsec) is one such setup. For all other types of VPN,
      the **Host** field is required.

      when the server sends a static-challenge. If the server does not send a
      static-challenge, the client will reply with only the password (without
      any encoding). This behavior is deprecated and new configurations should
      explicitly set one of the above values.

      See the fields **Password** and
      **OTP** for configuring the password and OTP.

## Client certificate patterns

In order to allow clients to securely key their private keys and request
certificates through PKCS#10 format or through a web flow, we provide
alternative CertificatePattern types. The

### CertificatePattern type

* **IssuerCARef**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * Array of references to certificates. At least one must have signed the
      client certificate.

* **Issuer**
    * (optional) - [IssuerSubjectPattern](#IssuerSubjectPattern-type)
    * Pattern to match the issuer X.509 settings against. If not specified, the
      only checks done will be a signature check against
      the **IssuerCARef** field. Issuer of the
      certificate must match this field exactly to match the pattern.

* **Subject**
    * (optional) - [IssuerSubjectPattern](#IssuerSubjectPattern-type)
    * Pattern to match the subject X.509 settings against. If not specified, the
      subject settings are not checked and any certificate matches. Subject of
      the certificate must match this field exactly to match the pattern.

* **EnrollmentURI**
    * (optional) - **array of string**
    * If no certificate matches this CertificatePattern, the first URI from this
      array with a recognized scheme is navigated to, with the intention this
      informs the user how to either get the certificate or gets the certificate
      for the user. For instance, the array may be [
      "chrome-extension://asakgksjssjwwkeielsjs/fetch-client-cert.html",
      "http://intra/connecting-to-wireless.html" ] so that for Chrome browsers a
      Chrome app or extension is shown to the user, but for other browsers, a
      web URL is shown.

### IssuerSubjectPattern type

* **CommonName**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Certificate subject's commonName must match this string if present.

* **Locality**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * Certificate subject's location must match this string if present.

* **Organization**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * At least one of certificate subject's organizations must match this string
      if present.

* **OrganizationalUnit**
    * (optional) - **string**
    * At least one of certificate subject's organizational units must match this
      string if present.

---
  * One field in **Subject**, **Issuer**, or **IssuerCARef**
    must be given for a [CertificatePattern](#CertificatePattern-type) typed
    field to be valid.
  * For a certificate to be considered matching, it must match all
    the fields in the certificate pattern. If multiple certificates match, the
    certificate with the latest issue date that is still in the past, and
    hence valid, will be used.
  * If **EnrollmentURI** is not given and no match is
    found to this pattern, the importing tool may show an error to the user.

      be necessary to unlock the SIM (and **LockType**
      changes to *sim-puk*).


## Tether Networks

For Tether connections, **Type** must be set to *Tether* and the
field **Tether** must be set to an object of type [Tether](#Tether-type).

Used for representing a tether hotspot provided by an external device, e.g.
a phone.

### Tether type

* **BatteryPercentage**

* **SignalStrength**
    * (optional, read-only) - **integer**
    * The current signal strength for the hotspot's connection in the range
      [0, 100]. Note that this value refers to the strength of the signal
      between the external device and its data provider, not the strength of the
      signal between the current device and the external device.


## Bluetooth / WiFi Direct Networks

This format will eventually also cover configuration of Bluetooth and WiFi
Direct network technologies, however they are currently not supported.


## Certificates

Certificate data is stored in a separate section. Each certificate may be
referenced from within the NetworkConfigurations array using a certificate
reference. A certificate reference is its GUID.

The top-level field **Certificates** is an array of
objects of [Certificate](#Certificate-type) type.

### Certificate type

* **GUID**
    * (required) - **string**
    * A unique identifier for this certificate. Must be a non-empty string.

* **PKCS12**
    * (required if **Type** is
        *Client*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * For certificates with
      private keys, this is the base64 encoding of the a PKCS#12 file.

* **Remove**
    * (optional, defaults to *false*) - **boolean**
    * If *true*, remove this certificate (only GUID
      should be set).

* **TrustBits**
    * (optional if **Type**
        is *Server*
        or *Authority*, otherwise ignored, defaults to []) - **array of string**
    * An array of trust flags. Clients should ignore unknown flags. For
      backwards compatibility, each flag should only increase the trust and
      never restrict. The trust flag *Web* implies that
      the certificate is to be trusted for HTTPS SSL identification. A typical
      web certificate authority would have **Type** set
      to *Authority* and **TrustBits** set to `["Web"]`

* **Type**
    * (required if **Remove** is *false*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * Allowed values are:
        * *Client*
        * *Server*
        * *Authority*
    * *Client* indicates the certificate is for
      identifying the user or device over HTTPS or for
      VPN/802.1X. *Server* indicates the certificate
      identifies an HTTPS or VPN/802.1X peer.
      *Authority* indicates the certificate is a
      certificate authority and any certificates it issues should be
      trusted. Note that if **Type** disagrees with the
      x509 v3 basic constraints or key usage attributes, the
      **Type** field should be honored.

* **X509**
    * (required if **Type** is
        *Server* or *Authority*, otherwise ignored) - **string**
    * For certificate
      without private keys, this is the X509 certificate in PEM format.

    The passphrase of the PKCS#12 encoding must be empty. Encryption of key data
    should be handled at the level of the entire file, or the transport of the
    file.

    If a global-scoped network connection refers to a user-scoped certificate,
    results are undefined, so this configuration should be prohibited by the
    configuration editor.


## Encrypted Configuration

We assume that when this format is imported as part of policy that
file-level encryption will not be necessary because the policy transport is
already encrypted, but when it is imported as a standalone file, it is
desirable to encrypt it. Since this file has private information (user
names) and secrets (passphrases and private keys) in it, and we want it to
be usable as a manual way to distribute network configuration, we must
support encryption.

For this standalone export, the entire file will be encrypted in a symmetric
fashion with a passphrase stretched using salted PBKDF2 using at least 20000
iterations, and encrypted using an AES-256 CBC mode cipher with an SHA-1
HMAC on the ciphertext.

An encrypted ONC file's top level object will have the
[EncryptedConfiguration](#EncryptedConfiguration-type) type.

### EncryptedConfiguration type

* **Cipher**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The type of cipher used. Currently only *AES256*
      is supported.

* **Ciphertext**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The raw ciphertext of the encrypted ONC file, base64 encoded.

* **HMAC**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The HMAC for the ciphertext, base64 encoded.

* **HMACMethod**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The method used to compute the Hash-based Message Authentication Code
      (HMAC). Currently only *SHA1* is supported.

* **Salt**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The salt value used during key stretching.

* **Stretch**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The key stretching algorithm used. Currently
      only *PBKDF2* is supported.

* **Iterations**
    * (required) - **integer**
    * The number of iterations to use during key stretching.

* **IV**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The initial vector (IV) used for Cyclic Block Cipher (CBC) mode, base64
      encoded.

* **Type**
    * (required) - **string**
    * The type of the ONC file, which must be set
      to *EncryptedConfiguration*.

---
  * When decrypted, the ciphertext must contain a JSON object of
    type [UnencryptedConfiguration](#UnencryptedConfiguration-type).
---

## String Expansions

The values of some fields, such
as **WiFi.EAP.Identity**
and **VPN.*.Username**, are subject to string
expansions. These allow one ONC to have basic user-specific variations.

### The expansions are:

* Placeholders that will only be replaced in user-specific ONC:
    * ${LOGIN\_ID} - expands to the email address of the user, but before
      the '@'.
    * ${LOGIN\_EMAIL} - expands to the email address of the user.

* Placeholders that will only be replaced in device-wide ONC:
    * ${DEVICE\_SERIAL\_NUMBER} - expands to the serial number of the device.
    * ${DEVICE\_ASSET\_ID} - expands to the administrator-set asset ID of the
      device.

* Placeholders that will only be replaced when a client certificate has been
  matched by a [CertificatePattern](#CertificatePattern-type):
    * ${CERT\_SAN\_EMAIL} - expands to the first RFC822 SubjectAlternativeName
      extracted from the client certificate.
    * ${CERT\_SAN\_UPN} - expands to the first OtherName SubjectAlternativeName
      with OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3 (UserPrincipalName) extracted from the
      client certificate.
    * ${CERT\_SUBJECT\_COMMON\_NAME} - expands to the ASCII value of the Subject
      CommonName extracted from the client certificate.

### The following SED would properly handle resolution.

* s/\$\{LOGIN\_ID\}/bobquail$1/g

* s/\$\{LOGIN\_EMAIL\}/bobquail@example.com$1/g

### Example expansions, assuming the user was bobquail@example.com:

* "${LOGIN\_ID}" -> "bobquail"

* "${LOGIN\_ID}@corp.example.com" -> "bobquail@corp.example.com"

* "${LOGIN\_EMAIL}" -> "bobquail@example.com"

* "${LOGIN\_ID}X" -> "bobquailX"

* "${LOGIN\_IDX}" -> "${LOGIN\_IDX}"

* "X${LOGIN\_ID}" -> "Xbobquail"


## String Substitutions
The value of **WiFi.EAP.Password** is subject to string substitution. These
differ from the **String Expansions** section above in that an exact match of
the substitution variable is required in order to substitute the real value.

### Example expansions, assuming the user password was *helloworld*:

* "${PASSWORD}" -> "helloworld"

* "${PASSWORD}foo" -> "${PASSWORD}foo"

## Detection

This format should be sent in files ending in the .onc extension. When
transmitted with a MIME type, the MIME type should be
application/x-onc. These two methods make detection of data to be handled in
this format, especially when encryption is used and the payload itself is
not detectable.


## Alternatives considered

For the overall format, we considered XML, ASN.1, and protobufs. JSON and
ASN.1 seem more widely known than protobufs. Since administrators are
likely to want to tweak settings that will not exist in common UIs, we
should provide a format that is well known and human modifiable. ASN.1 is
not human modifiable. Protobufs formats are known by open source developers
but seem less likely to be known by administrators. JSON serialization
seems to have good support across languages.

We considered sending the exact connection manager configuration format of
an open source connection manager like connman. There are a few issues
here, for instance, referencing certificates by identifiers not tied to a
particular PKCS#11 token, and tying to one OS's connection manager.

## Examples

### Simple format example: PEAP/MSCHAPv2 network (per device)

```
{
  "Type": "UnencryptedConfiguration",
  "NetworkConfigurations": [
    {
      "GUID": "{f2c17903-b0e1-8593-b3ca74f977236bd7}",
      "Name": "MySSID",
      "Type": "WiFi",
      "WiFi": {
        "AutoConnect": true,
        "EAP": {
          "Outer": "PEAP",
          "UseSystemCAs": true
        },
        "HiddenSSID": false,
        "SSID": "MySSID",
        "Security": "WPA-EAP"
      }
    }
  ],
  "Certificates": []
}
```

Notice that in this case, we do not provide a username and password - we set
SaveCredentials to *false* so we are prompted every
time. We could have passed in username and password - but such a file should
be encrypted.

### Complex format example: TLS network with client certs (per device)

```

  "Type": "UnencryptedConfiguration",
  "NetworkConfigurations": [

    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the client certificate is not sent in the ONC format, but
rather we send a certificate authority which we know will have signed the
client certificate that is needed, along with an enrollment URI to navigate
to if the required certificate is not yet available on the client.

### Simple format example: HTTPS Certificate Authority

In this example a new certificate authority is added to be trusted for HTTPS
server authentication.

### Encrypted format example

In this example a simple wireless network is added, but the file is encrypted
with the passphrase "test0000".

```

## Standalone editor

The source code for a Chrome packaged app to generate ONC configuration can
be found here: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/spigots/

## Internationalization and Localization

UIs will need to have internationalization and localizations - the file
format will remain in English.

## Security Considerations

Data stored inside of open network configuration files is highly sensitive
to users and enterprises. The file format itself provides adequate
encryption options to allow standalone use-cases to be secure. For automatic
updates sent by policy, the policy transport should be made secure. The file
should not be stored unencrypted on disk as part of policy fetching and
should be cleared from memory after use.

## Privacy Considerations

Similarly to the security considerations, user names will be present in
these files for certain kinds of connections, so any places where the file
is transmitted or saved to disk should be secure. On client device, when
user names for connections that are user-specific are persisted to disk,
they should be stored in a location that is encrypted. Users can also opt in
these cases to not save their user credentials in the config file and will
instead be prompted when they are needed.
