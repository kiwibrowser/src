// destructor will run when the last reference is dropped, which may or may not
// be after the corresponding BrowserContext has been destroyed.

// Optionally, if you initialize your service with the constructor that takes a
// SequencedTaskRunner, your service will be deleted on that sequence. We
// can't use content::DeleteOnThread<> directly because RefcountedKeyedService
