// them encoded as a compact string at most twice. The sent data does
// not contain information that can be used to identify a user or to infer
// browsing habits. The API in this file is a wrapper around the open source
// RLZ library which can be found at http://code.google.com/p/rlz.
//
// For partner or bundled installs, the RLZ might send more information
// according to the terms disclosed in the EULA.
