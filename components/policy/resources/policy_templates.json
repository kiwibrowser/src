# policy_templates.json - Metafile for policy templates
#
# The content of this file is evaluated as a Python expression.
#
# This file is used as input to generate the following policy templates:
# ADM, ADMX+ADML, MCX/plist and html documentation.
#
# Policy templates are user interface definitions or documents about the
# policies that can be used to configure Chrome. Each policy is a name-value
# pair where the value has a given type. Chrome looks up the values using the
# names of the policies. In the user interface where the values can be set,
# related policies might appear together in policy groups. The grouping is not
# visible to Chrome.
#
# This file contains a list of policies and groups. Each group contains a list
# of policies under the key 'policies'. All the policies and groups must have
# unique names. Group names are not exposed to Chrome at all.
#
# Each policy has a type. The currently implemented types:
#   'group': - not a real policy, contains a list of policies
#     NOTE: Currently nesting groups inside other groups is not supported.
#   'string' - a string value
#   'int' - an integer value
#   'int-enum' - the user can select an integer value from a collection of
#     items
#   'string-enum' - the user can select a string value from a collection of
#     items
#   'string-enum-list' - the user can select a set of string values from a
#     collection of items
#   'main' - a boolean value
#   'list' - a list of string values
#   'dict' - a dictionary value, containing other values indexed by strings
#   'external' - a policy that references external data.
#     NOTE: This type is currently supported on Chrome OS only.
#
# Each policy is tagged with risk tags that indicate potential privacy or
# security risks. They are defined at the beginning of this file (tag
# 'risk_tag_definitions').
# Each risk tag contains the following information:
#   - name: The name of the risk tag. May not contain spaces.
#   - description: Description for developers so they know which tags apply to
#       newly added policies.
#   - user-description: A text that helps users understand what a policy with
#       this tag means for their privacy and/or security.
# TODO(fhorschig|tnagel): Revisit policy tags after reviews.
#
# Policy group descriptions, policy captions and similar texts are localized
# strings taken from the <message> nodes of the .grd file. Their name attributes
# are generated from the JSON keys.
# Each item (policy or group) may have the following messages:
#   - description:
#     Describes the item it applies to.
#   - caption
#     A short, one-line summary of the item it applies to. This can appear
#     both in policy or group listings or on title bars of policy-setting
#     windows. (The caption should not end with a punctuation mark.)
#   - label (Optional, defaults to caption if not specified.)
#     A short, one-line summary of the item it applies to. The difference
#     from caption is that label always appears next to the entry field
#     where the value of the policy can be entered. 'main' policies on
#     Windows ignore this. Policies on Mac are using this instead of caption.
#
# As a reference for translators, non-translateable strings must be tagged using
# <ph name="..."></ph> as described in [1]. As these tags are pruned before
# generating the comments for .proto files, paragraphs containing such tags
# should not be line-wrapped (use one long line per paragraph instead) to allow
# for correct re-flowing of the text.
# [1] https://www.chromium.org/developers/tools-we-use-in-chromium/grit/grit-users-guide.
#
# Generated grd names:
#   Each name has two parts: the second part is either CAPTION, DESC or LABEL,
#   and the first part identifies the item the text applies to:
#   -For policies and groups:
#     IDS_POLICY_<NAME OF THE POLICY OR GROUP>
#     e.g. the name of the caption of policy HomepageLocation:
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_CAPTION
#     or other messages of the policy HomepageLocation:
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_LABEL
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_DESC
#   -For enum items:
#     IDS_POLICY_ENUM_<NAME OF THE ITEM>
#     e.g. the name of the caption of ProxyServerDisabled:
#       IDS_POLICY_ENUM_PROXYSERVERDISABLED_CAPTION
#
# Products and versions:
#   Each policy has the list of products and version numbers where it is
#   supported under the key 'supported_on'. Each item of this list has the
#   form of 'product:since_version-until_version', which means that support
#   for the policy in 'product' was introduced in 'since_version' and removed
#   after 'until_version'. Product names may contain a suffix specifying a
#   platform name, e.g.: 'chrome.win' is read as 'Chrome on Windows'. Version
#   numbers can be any string that does not contain ':' or '-' characters.
#
#   Currently supported product names:
#       'chrome_frame', 'chrome_os', 'android', 'webview_android',
#       'chrome.win', 'chrome.linux', 'chrome.mac', 'chrome.*'
#     For example if 'chrome.*:5-10' is specified for a policy, then it should
#     be read as:
#       'chrome.linux:5-10', 'chrome.mac:5-10', 'chrome.win:5-10'
#
#   The product name also affects in which templates the policy is included:
#     chrome.*, chrome.win, chrome_frame -> ADM, ADMX, ADML, doc
#     chrome.*, chrome.linux -> JSON, doc
#     chrome.*, chrome.mac -> plist, plist_strings, doc
#     everything else -> doc
#
#   The default list of policies supported by Chrome is also generated based
#   on the product names:
#     chrome.* -> Chrome policy definition list
#     chrome_os -> Chrome policy definition list, when building OS_CHROMEOS
#
# Annotations:
#   Additional information is specified under keys 'features' and
#   'example_value'. These are used in the generated documentation and example
#   policy configuration files. 'dynamic_refresh' controls if the generated
#   documentation should state that the policy supports dynamic refresh or not.
#   Supporting dynamic refresh means that Chrome respects the changes to the
#   policy immediately, without the need for restart.
#   'can_be_mandatory' Set to False to suppress the policy in the generated
#   mandatory policy templates. The generated documentation for the policy
#   will contain a suitable hint for administrators.
#   'can_be_recommended' Set to True to include the policy in the generated
#   recommended policy templates. The generated documentation for the policy
#   will contain a suitable hint for administrators.
#   Policies settings in the mandatory template override user preferences, while
#   recommended policies provide a default setting that may be overridden by the
#   user. By default, each policy is mandatory and not recommended.
#   'per_profile' controls whether a user policy applies to every user logging
#   into the browser or only one profile.
#
#   The 'max_size' key is used to specify the maximal size of the external data
#   that a policy can reference, in bytes. This annotation is compulsory for
#   policies of type 'external'. It is ignored for all other policy types.
#
#   The 'future' key is used to indicate that a policy isn't yet ready for
#   usage. It defaults to False, and currently affects the generated policy
#   templates and documentation. The policy definition list that Chrome sees
#   will include policies marked with 'future'. If a WIP policy isn't meant to
#   be seen by the policy providers either, the 'supported_on' key should be set
#   to an empty list.
#
# IDs:
#   Since a Protocol Buffer definition is generated from this file, unique and
#   persistent IDs for all fields (but not for groups!) are needed. These are
#   specified by the 'id' keys of each policy. NEVER CHANGE EXISTING IDs,
#   because doing so would break the deployed wire format!
#   For your editing convenience: highest ID currently used: 450
#   And don't forget to also update the EnterprisePolicies enum of
#   histograms.xml (run 'python tools/metrics/histograms/update_policies.py').
#   A policy can be delete if and only if a policy is never launched but has
#   been introduced in this file. To prevent reuse of its id it has to be then
#   added to the 'deleted_policy_ids' list.
#
# Placeholders:
#   The following placeholder strings are automatically substituted:
#     $1 -> Google Chrome / Chromium
#     $2 -> Google Chrome OS / Chromium OS
#     $3 -> Google Chrome Frame / Chromium Frame
#     $6 is reserved for doc_writer
#
# Device Policy:
#   An additional flag 'device_only' (optional, defaults to False) indicates
#   that this policy is only supported as a device-level Cloud Policy. In that
#   case no entry in the UserPolicy Protobuf is generated and it is assumed that
#   it will be added to the DevicePolicy Protobuf manually. Device policy only
#   exists on Chrome OS.
#
# Management Type:
#   Chrome OS devices can either be managed through the Google cloud or through
#   Active Directory. Most policies are supported for both management types, but
#   some are not. To indicate supported management types, use
#     'supported_chrome_os_management': ['google_cloud', 'active_directory'],
#   where
#     'google_cloud' = Policy is supported for Google cloud management.
#     'active_directory' = Policy is supported for Active Directory management.
#   This setting applies to Chrome OS only. If the setting is missing, both
#   types are assumed. The array must not be empty.
#
# Enterprise defaults for user policy:
#   For managed users on Chrome OS (i.e. users receiving user policy from the
#   cloud), if the optional key 'default_for_enterprise_users' is set, its value
#   is applied as mandatory policy unless a different setting is received from
#   the cloud. This default value handling is automatically enforced by the
#   policy stack when filling the PolicyMap (specifically, by the generated
#   function SetEnterpriseUsersDefaults).
#
# Enterprise defaults for device policy:
#   The optional key 'default_for_managed_devices_doc_only' can be used to
#   document a differing default value for devices enrolled into enterprise
#   management. This is for documentation only - the enrollment-dependent
#   handling must be manually implemented.

          enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension

          For Windows instances that are not joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

          Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an "update" URL separated by a semicolon (<ph name="SEMICOLON">;</ph>). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on <ph name="CHROME_EXTENSIONS_LINK">chrome://extensions</ph> when in developer mode. The "update" URL, if specified, should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC1">https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate</ph>. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"). Note that the "update" URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest.

In case the delay is set to zero, <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google Chrome OS</ex></ph> will not take the corresponding action.

          For each of the above delays, when the length of time is unset, a default value will be used.

      If the policy is not configured, the user will be able to change this setting.

      NOTE: On Android, Site Isolation is experimental. Support will improve over time, but currently it may cause performance problems.

      NOTE: This policy applies only to Chrome on Android running on devices with strictly more than 1GB of RAM. To apply the policy on non-Android platforms, use SitePerProcess.

          The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked.

The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

These policies are strictly intended to be used to configure instances of <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> internal to your organization.
