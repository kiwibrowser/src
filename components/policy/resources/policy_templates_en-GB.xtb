          enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension
          APIs. (These two APIs are not available to apps/extensions that are
          not force-installed.)

          This policy takes precedence over a potentially conflicting <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_BLACKLIST_POLICY_NAME" /> policy. If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />.

          For Windows instances that are not joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME" /> domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

          Note that the source code of any extension may be altered by users via Developer Tools (potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional). If this is a concern, the <ph name="DEVELOPER_TOOLS_POLICY_NAME" /> policy should be set.

          Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an 'update' URL separated by a semicolon (<ph name="SEMICOLON" />). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on <ph name="CHROME_EXTENSIONS_LINK" /> when in developer mode. The 'update' URL, if specified, should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC1" />. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is 'https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx'). Note that the 'update'URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest. Note also that specifying the 'update' URL explicitly was mandatory in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> versions up to and including 67.

          For example, <ph name="EXTENSION_POLICY_EXAMPLE" /> installs the <ph name="EXTENSION_POLICY_EXAMPLE_EXTENSION_NAME" /> app from the standard Chrome Web Store 'update' URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC2" />.

They represent the manufacturer and model of the printer. <ph name="PRINTER_URI" /> should be an address reachable from a client computer including the <ph name="URI_SCHEME" />, <ph name="URI_PORT" /> and <ph name="URI_QUEUE" />. <ph name="PRINTER_UUID" /> is optional. If provided, it is used to help de-duplicate <ph name="ZEROCONF_DISCOVERY" /> printers.

      <ph name="PRINTER_EFFECTIVE_MODEL" /> must match one of the strings which represent a <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />-supported printer. The string will be used to identify and install the appropriate PPD for the printer. More information can be found at https://support.google.com/chrome?p=noncloudprint.

      Printer setup is completed upon the first use of a printer. PPDs are not downloaded until the printer is used. After that time, frequently used PPDs are cached.

      This policy has no effect on whether users can configure printers on individual devices. It is intended to be supplementary to the configuration of printers by individual users.

      For Active Directory managed devices this policy supports expansion of <ph name="MACHINE_NAME_VARIABLE" /> to the Active Directory machine name or a substring of it.

      This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

      In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognised as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME" />.

      A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the '/' character and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognised hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is 'sha256'.

      If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</translation>

          The |time_window_limit| specifies a daily window in which the user's session should be locked. We only support one rule for each day of the week, therefore the |entries| array may vary from 0–7 in size. |starts_at| and |ends_at| are the beginning and the end of the window limit, when |ends_at| is smaller than |starts_at| it means that the |time_limit_window| ends on the following day. |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated. It is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so that when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should only be set if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be used in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset,_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time that this entry was updated. It is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          |overrides| is provided to invalidate temporarily one or more of the previous rules.
          * If neither time_window_limit nor time_usage_limit is active |LOCK| can be used to lock the device.

          * |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.
          |created_time_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the override creation. It is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer. It is used to determine whether this override should still be applied. If the current active time limit feature (time usage limit or time window limit) started after the override was created, it should not take action.

<translation id="780603170519840350">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

      This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

      In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
      1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
      2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
      3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

      A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the '/' character and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognised hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is 'sha256'.

      If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</translation>
