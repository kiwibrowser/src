# Feed Host Component

Feed host is a component providing necessary APIs for hosting a third party
[Feed](https://chromium.googlesource.com/feed) library in Chrome. Initially the
Feed library is only supporting Chrome for Android, but most of the host API
implementations are designed to be reusable on other platforms.

Library code and host API definitions can be found under
[//third_party/feed/](../../third_party/feed/). More information about the
library is available in the [README.md](../../third_party/feed/src/README.md).
