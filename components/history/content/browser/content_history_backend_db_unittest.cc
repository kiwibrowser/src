// History unit tests come in two flavors:
//
// 1. The more complicated style is that the unit test creates a full history
//    service. This spawns a background thread for the history backend, and
//    all communication is asynchronous. This is useful for testing more
//    complicated things or end-to-end behavior.
//
// 2. The simpler style is to create a history backend on this thread and
//    access it directly without a HistoryService object. This is much simpler
//    because communication is synchronous. Generally, sets should go through
//    the history backend (since there is a lot of logic) but gets can come
//    directly from the HistoryDatabase. This is because the backend generally
//    has no logic in the getter except threading stuff, which we don't want
//    to run.
