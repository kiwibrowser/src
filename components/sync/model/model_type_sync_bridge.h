// implementations must provide their change_processor() with metadata through
// ModelReadyToSync() as soon as possible. Once this is called, sync will
// immediately begin locally tracking changes and can start syncing with the
// server soon afterward. If an error occurs during startup, the processor's
// ReportError() method should be called instead of ModelReadyToSync().
