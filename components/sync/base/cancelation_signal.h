// This class is used to allow one thread to request that another abort and

// The signalling thread owns this class and my call Signal() at any time.
// After that call, this class' IsSignalled() will always return true.  The
// intended use case is that the task intending to support early exit will
// periodically check the value of IsSignalled() to see if it should return
// early.
//
// The receiving task may also choose to register an CancelationObserver whose
// OnSignalReceived() method will be executed on the signaller's thread when
// Signal() is called.  This may be used for sending an early Signal() to a
// WaitableEvent.  The registration of the handler is necessarily racy.  If
// Signal() is executes before TryRegisterHandler(), TryRegisterHandler() will
// not perform any registration and return false.  That function's caller must
// handle this case.
//
// This class supports only one handler, though it could easily support multiple
// observers if we found a use case for such a feature.
