// Encrypted sync data consists of two parts: a key name and a blob. Key name is
// the name of the key that was used to encrypt blob and blob is encrypted data
// itself.
//
// The reason we need to keep track of the key name is that a sync user can
// change their passphrase (and thus their encryption key) at any time. When
// that happens, we make a best effort to reencrypt all nodes with the new
// passphrase, but since we don't have transactions on the server-side, we
// cannot guarantee that every node will be reencrypted. As a workaround, we
// keep track of all keys, assign each key a name (by using that key to encrypt
// a well known string) and keep track of which key was used to encrypt each
// node.
