/**
 * The CrashFileManager is responsible for managing the "Crash Reports" directory containing
 * minidump files and shepherding them through a state machine represented by the file names. Note
 * that the second step is optional.
 *  1. foo.dmp is a minidump file, written to the directory by Breakpad.
 * (2) foo.dmpNNNNN is a minidump file, where NNNNN is the PID (process id) of the crashing
 *     process. This step is optional -- that is, a minidump could fail to have its PID included in
 *     the filename.
 *  3. foo.dmp.try0 or foo.dmpNNNNN.try0 is a minidump file with recent logcat output attached to
 *     it; or a file for which logcat output has been intentionally omitted. Notably,
 *     Webview-generated minidumps do not include logcat output.
 *  4. foo.dmpNNNNN.tryM for M > 0 is a minidump file that's been attempted to be uploaded to the
 *     crash server, but for which M upload attempts have failed.
 *  5. foo.up.tryM and foo.upNNNNN.tryM are both valid possible names for a successfully uploaded
 *     file.
 *  6. foo.skipped.tryM and foo.skippedNNNNN.tryM are both valid possible names for a file whose
 *     upload was skipped. An upload may be skipped, for example, if the user has not consented to
 *     uploading crash reports. These files are marked as skipped rather than deleted immediately to
 *     allow the user to manually initiate an upload.
 *  7. foo.forced.tryM and foo.forcedNNNNN.tryM are both valid possible names for a file that the
 *     user has manually requested to upload.
 *  8. foo.tmp is a temporary file.
