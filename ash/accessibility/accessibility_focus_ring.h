// An AccessibilityFocusRing is a special type of shape designed to
// outline the focused object on the screen for users with visual
// impairments. It's specifically designed to outline text ranges that
// span multiple lines (we'll call this a "paragraph" shape from here on,
// but it works for any text range), so it can outline a shape defined by a
// few words from the first line, the complete contents of more lines,
// followed by a few words from the last line. See the figure below.
// When highlighting any other object, it outlines a rectangular shape.
//
// The outline is outset from the object it's highlighting by a few pixels;
// this margin distance also determines its border radius for rounded
// corners.
//
// An AccessibilityFocusRing can be initialized with either a rectangle
// defining the bounds of an object, or a paragraph-shape with three
// rectangles defining a top line, a body, and a bottom line, which are
// assumed to be adjacent to one another.
//
// Initializing an AccessibilityFocusRing computes the following 36 points
// that completely define the shape's outline. This shape can be traced
// using Skia or any other drawing utility just by drawing alternating
// straight lines and quadratic curves (e.g. a line from 0 to 1, a curve
// from 1 to 3 with 2 as a control point, then a line from 3 to 4, and so on.
//
// The same path should be used even if the focus ring was initialized with
// a rectangle and not a paragraph shape - this makes it possible to
// smoothly animate between one object and the next simply by interpolating
// points.
//
// Noncontiguous shapes should be handled by drawing multiple focus rings.
//
// The 36 points are defined as follows:
//
//          2 3------------------------------4 5
