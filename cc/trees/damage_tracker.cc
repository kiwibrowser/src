    LayerTreeImpl* layer_tree_impl,
    const RenderSurfaceList& render_surface_list) {
  //
  // This function computes the "damage rect" of each target surface, and
  // updates the state that is used to correctly track damage across frames. The
  // damage rect is the region of the surface that may have changed and needs to
  // be redrawn. This can be used to scissor what is actually drawn, to save GPU
  // computation and bandwidth.
  //
  // The surface's damage rect is computed as the union of all possible changes
  // that have happened to the surface since the last frame was drawn. This
  // includes:
  //   - any changes for existing layers/surfaces that contribute to the target
  //     surface
  //   - layers/surfaces that existed in the previous frame, but no longer exist
  //
  // The basic algorithm for computing the damage region is as follows:
  //
  //   1. compute damage caused by changes in contributing layers or surfaces
  //       for each contributing layer or render surface:
  //           add the layer's or surface's damage to the target surface.
  //
  //   2. compute damage caused by the target surface's mask, if it exists.
  //
  //   3. compute damage caused by old layers/surfaces that no longer exist
  //       for each leftover layer or render surface:
  //           add the old layer/surface bounds to the target surface damage.
  //
  //   4. combine all partial damage rects to get the full damage rect.
  //
  // Additional important points:
  //
  // - This algorithm requires that descendant surfaces compute their damage
  //   before ancestor surfaces. Further, since contributing surfaces with
  //   background filters can expand the damage caused by contributors
  //   underneath them (that is, before them in draw order), the exact damage
  //   caused by these contributors must be computed before computing the damage
  //   caused by the contributing surface. This is implemented by visiting
  //   layers in draw order, computing the damage caused by each one to their
  //   target; during this walk, as soon as all of a surface's contributors have
  //   been visited, the surface's own damage is computed and then added to its
  //   target's accumulated damage.
  //
  // - Changes to layers/surfaces indicate "damage" to the target surface; If a
  //   layer is not changed, it does NOT mean that the layer can skip drawing.
  //   All layers that overlap the damaged region still need to be drawn. For
  //   example, if a layer changed its opacity, then layers underneath must be
  //   re-drawn as well, even if they did not change.
  //
  // - If a layer/surface property changed, the old bounds and new bounds may
  //   overlap... i.e. some of the exposed region may not actually be exposing
  //   anything. But this does not artificially inflate the damage rect. If the
  //   layer changed, its entire old bounds would always need to be redrawn,
  //   regardless of how much it overlaps with the layer's new bounds, which
  //   also need to be entirely redrawn.
  //
  // - See comments in the rest of the code to see what exactly is considered a
  //   "change" in a layer/surface.
  //
  // - To correctly manage exposed rects, SortedRectMap is maintained:
  //
  //      1. All existing rects from the previous frame are marked as
  //         not updated.
  //      2. The map contains all the layer bounds that contributed to
  //         the previous frame (even outside the previous damaged area). If a
  //         layer changes or does not exist anymore, those regions are then
  //         exposed and damage the target surface. As the algorithm progresses,
  //         entries are updated in the map until only leftover layers
  //         that no longer exist stay marked not updated.
  //
  //      3. After the damage rect is computed, the leftover not marked regions
  //         in a map are used to compute are damaged by deleted layers and
  //         erased from map.
