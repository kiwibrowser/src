// When a change to the compositor's state/invalidation/whatever happens, a
// Swap Promise can be inserted into LayerTreeHost/LayerTreeImpl, to track
// whether the compositor's reply to the new state/invaliadtion/whatever is
// completed in the compositor, i.e. the compositor knows it has been sent
// to its output or not.
//
// If the commit results in a successful activation of the pending layer tree,
// SwapPromise::DidActivate() will be called.
//
// If the new compositor state is goint to be sent to the output,
// SwapPromise::WillSwap() will be called before the swap and
// SwapPromise::DidSwap() will be called once the swap is over.
//
// If the scheduler fails to activate the pending tree, or the compositor
// fails to send its new state to the output, SwapPromise::DidNotSwap() will
// be called. Note that it is possible to activate, and subsequently not swap.
//
// Promises complete afer either DidSwap() or DidNotSwap() is called, thus
// there are three possible call sequences:
//   DidNotSwap()
//   DidActivate() ; WillSwap(); DidSwap()
//   DidActivate() ; DidNotSwap()
//
// Clients that wish to use SwapPromise should have a subclass that defines
// the behavior of DidActivate(), WillSwap(), DidSwap() and DidNotSwap(). Notice
// that the promise can be broken at either main or impl thread, e.g. commit
// fails on main thread, new frame data has no actual damage so
// LayerTreeHostImpl::SwapBuffers() bails out early on impl thread, so don't
// assume that Did*() methods are called at a particular thread. It is better
// to let the subclass carry thread-safe member data and operate on that
// member data in Did*().
