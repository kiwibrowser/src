// ImageDecodeCache is responsible for generating decode tasks, decoding
// images, storing images in cache, and being able to return the decoded images
// when requested.

// ImageDecodeCache is responsible for the following things:
// 1. Given a DrawImage, it can return an TileTask which when run will
//    decode and cache the resulting image. If the image does not need a task to
//    be decoded, then nullptr will be returned. The return value of the
//    function indicates whether the image was or is going to be locked, so an
//    unlock will be required.
// 2. Given a cache key and a DrawImage, it can decode the image and store it in
//    the cache. Note that it is important that this function is only accessed
//    via an image decode task.
// 3. Given a DrawImage, it can return a DecodedDrawImage, which represented the
//    decoded version of the image. Note that if the image is not in the cache
//    and it needs to be scaled/decoded, then this decode will happen as part of
//    getting the image. As such, this should only be accessed from a raster
//    thread.
