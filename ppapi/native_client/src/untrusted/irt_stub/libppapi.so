 * This is a linker script installed as "libppapi.so" so that "-lppapi"

 * that defines a main function for PPAPI-based programs.  It's silly to
 * use a shared library for a tiny library that defines main and has
 * undefined symbols the application must define, so we link ppapi_stub
 * statically.  That library requires libpthread, so we (dynamically)
 * link to it here as well.
