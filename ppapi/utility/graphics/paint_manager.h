/// This class converts the "instance push" model of painting in PPAPI to a
/// paint request at a later time. Usage is that you call Invalidate and

/// then get called with coalesced paint events.
///
/// This class is basically a <code>PaintAggregator</code> that groups updates,
/// plus management of callbacks for scheduling paints.
///
/// <strong>Example:</strong>
///
/// <code>
///
///  class MyClass : public pp::Instance, public PaintManager::Client {
///   public:
///    MyClass() {
///      paint_manager_.Initialize(this, this, false);
///    }
///
///    void ViewChanged(const pp::Rect& position, const pp::Rect& clip) {
///      paint_manager_.SetSize(position.size());
///    }
///
///    void DoSomething() {
///      // This function does something like respond to an event that causes
///      // the screen to need updating.
///      paint_manager_.InvalidateRect(some_rect);
///    }
///
///    // Implementation of PaintManager::Client
///    virtual bool OnPaint(pp::Graphics2D& device,
///                         const pp::PaintUpdate& update) {
///      // If our app needed scrolling, we would apply that first here.
///
///      // Then we would either repaint the area returned by GetPaintBounds or
///      // iterate through all the paint_rects.
///
