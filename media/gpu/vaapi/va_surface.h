// A VA-API-specific decode surface used by VaapiH264Decoder to decode into
// and use as reference for decoding other surfaces. It is also handed by the
// decoder to VaapiVideoDecodeAccelerator when the contents of the surface are
// ready and should be displayed. VAVDA converts the surface contents into an
// X/Drm Pixmap bound to a texture for display and releases its reference to it.
// Decoder releases its references to the surface when it's done decoding and
// using it as reference. Note that a surface may still be used for reference
// after it's been sent to output and also after it is no longer used by VAVDA.
// Thus, the surface can be in use by both VAVDA and the Decoder at the same
// time, or by either of them, with the restriction that VAVDA will never get
// the surface until the contents are ready, and it is guaranteed that the
// contents will not change after that.
// When both the decoder and VAVDA release their references to the surface,
// it is freed and the release callback is executed to put the surface back
// into available surfaces pool, which is managed externally.
//
