// Implementation notes:
//
// - It is recommended to first acquire the native sample rate of the default
//   output device and then use the same rate when creating this object.
//   Use AudioManagerMac::HardwareSampleRate() to retrieve the sample rate.
// - Calling Close() also leads to self destruction.
// - The latency consists of two parts:
//   1) Hardware latency, which includes Audio Unit latency, audio device
//      latency;
//   2) The delay between the moment getting the callback and the scheduled time
//      stamp that tells when the data is going to be played out.

// Implementation of AudioOuputStream for Mac OS X using the
// AUHAL Audio Unit present in OS 10.4 and later.
// It is useful for low-latency output.
//
// Overview of operation:
// 1) An object of AUHALStream is created by the AudioManager factory on the
//    object's main thread via audio_man->MakeAudioStream().  Calls to the
//    control routines (Open/Close/Start/Stop), must be made on this thread.
// 2) Next Open() will be called. At that point the underlying AUHAL Audio Unit
//    is created and configured to use the |device|.
// 3) Then Start(source) is called and the device is started which creates its
//    own thread (or uses an existing background thread) on which the AUHAL's
//    callback will periodically ask for more data as buffers are being
//    consumed.
//    Note that all AUHAL instances receive callbacks on that very same
//    thread, so avoid any contention in the callback as to not cause delays for
//    other instances.
// 4) At some point Stop() will be called, which we handle by stopping the
//    output Audio Unit.
// 6) Lastly, Close() will be called where we cleanup and notify the audio
//    manager, which will delete the object.

// TODO(tommi): Since the callback audio thread is shared for all instances of
// AUHALStream, one stream blocking, can cause others to be delayed.  Several
// occurrances of this can cause a buildup of delay which forces the OS
// to skip rendering frames. One known cause of this is the synchronzation
// between the browser and render process in AudioSyncReader.
// We need to fix this.
