// This class represents a RTCP session on a RTP sender. It provides an
// interface to send RTCP sender report (SR). RTCP SR packets allow
// receiver to maintain clock offsets and synchronize between audio and video.
//
// RTCP session on sender handles the following incoming RTCP reports
// from receiver and passes the information to a RtcpObserver:
// - Receiver reference time report: Helps with tracking largest timestamp
//   seen and as a result rejecting old RTCP reports.
// - Receiver logs: The sender receives log events from the receiver.
// - cast message: Receives feedback from receiver on missing packets/frames,
//   later frames received, and last frame id.
// - Last report: The receiver provides feedback on delay since last report
//   received which helps it compute round trip time.
// - PLI: Receiver sends PLI when decoding error exists on ultra-low latency
//   applications.
