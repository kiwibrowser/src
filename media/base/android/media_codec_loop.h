// MediaCodecLoop is based on Android's MediaCodec API.
// The MediaCodec API is required to play encrypted (as in EME) content on
// Android. It is also a way to employ hardware-accelerated decoding.
// One MediaCodecLoop instance owns a single MediaCodec(Bridge) instance, and
// drives it to perform decoding in conjunction with a MediaCodecLoop::Client.
// The Client provides the input data and consumes the output data.  A typical
// example is AndroidVideoDecodeAccelerator.

// Implementation notes.
//
// The MediaCodec works by exchanging buffers between the client and the codec
// itself.  On the input side, an "empty" buffer has to be dequeued from the
// codec, filled with data, and queued back.  On the output side, a "full"
// buffer with data should be dequeued, the data used, and the buffer returned
// back to the codec.
//
// Neither input nor output dequeue operations are guaranteed to succeed: the
// codec might not have available input buffers yet, or not every encoded buffer
// has arrived to complete an output frame. In such case the client should try
// to dequeue a buffer again at a later time.
//
// There is also a special situation related to an encrypted stream, where the
// enqueuing of a filled input buffer might fail due to lack of the relevant key
// in the CDM module.  While MediaCodecLoop does not handle the CDM directly,
// it does understand the codec state.
//
// Much of that logic is common to all users of MediaCodec.  The MediaCodecLoop
// provides the main driver loop to talk to MediaCodec.  Via the Client
// interface, MediaCodecLoop can request input data, send output buffers, etc.
// MediaCodecLoop does not construct a MediaCodec, but instead takes ownership
// of one that it provided during construction.
//
// Although one can specify a delay in the MediaCodec's dequeue operations,
// this implementation uses polling.  We can't tell in advance if a call into
// MediaCodec will block indefinitely, and we don't want to block the thread
// waiting for it.
//
// This implementation detects that the MediaCodec is idle (no input or output
// buffer processing) and after being idle for a predefined time the timer
// stops.  The client is responsible for signalling us to wake up via a call
// to DoPendingWork.  It is okay for the client to call this even when the timer
// is already running.
//
// The current implementation is single threaded. Every method is supposed to
// run on the same thread.
