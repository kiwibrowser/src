// A thread-safe class that does the bookkeeping and lifetime management for a
// pool of pixel buffers cycled between an in-process producer (e.g. a
// VideoCaptureDevice) and a set of out-of-process consumers. The pool is
// intended to be orchestrated by a VideoCaptureDevice::Client, but is designed
// to outlive the controller if necessary. The pixel buffers may be backed by a
// SharedMemory, but this is not compulsory.
//
// Producers get a buffer by calling ReserveForProducer(), and may pass on their
// ownership to the consumer by calling HoldForConsumers(), or drop the buffer
// (without further processing) by calling RelinquishProducerReservation().
// Consumers signal that they are done with the buffer by calling
// RelinquishConsumerHold().
//
// Buffers are allocated on demand, but there will never be more than |count|
// buffers in existence at any time. Buffers are identified by an int value
// called |buffer_id|. -1 (kInvalidId) is never a valid ID, and is returned by
// some methods to indicate failure. The active set of buffer ids may change
// over the lifetime of the buffer pool, as existing buffers are freed and
// reallocated at larger size. When reallocation occurs, new buffer IDs will
// circulate.
