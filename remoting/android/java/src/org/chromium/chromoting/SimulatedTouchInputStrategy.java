        // the UI elements were probably designed for mouse and keyboard (meaning smaller targets)
        // and the image itself which can be zoomed to change the size of the targets.  Ths adds up

        // Android UI element.  Our approach to this problem is to make double-tap detection
        // consistent regardless of the zoom level or remote target size so that the user can rely
        // on their muscle memory when interacting with our UI.  With respect to the original
        // problem, getScaledDoubleTapSlop() gives a value which is optimized for an Android based
        // UI however this value is too large for interacting with remote elements in our app.
        // Our solution is to use the original value from getScaledDoubleTapSlop() (which includes
        // scaling to account for display differences between devices) and apply a fudge/scale
