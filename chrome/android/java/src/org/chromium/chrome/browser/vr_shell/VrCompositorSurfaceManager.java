/**
 * Provides the texture-backed surface used for drawing Android UI in VR to the CompositorView.
 * This class only partially fulfills the contract that the CompositorSurfaceManagerImpl fulfills.
 *
 * This class doesn't use SurfaceViews, as the texture-backed surface is drawn using GL during VR
 * scene compositing. This class also doesn't really manage the Surface in any way, and fakes the
 * standard Surface/View lifecycle so that the compositor remains unaware of this. The surface
 * format requested by the compositor is also ignored.
