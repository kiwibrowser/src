Description:
Closure Library is a powerful, low level JavaScript library designed
for building complex and scalable web applications.

Local Modifications:
Only the files actually used by ChromeVox are kept. This includes a small
number of javaScript source files and a few python modules to scan sources for
closure dependencies.  In addition:
- closure/goog/i18n/messageformat.js was changed to use
  Number.prototype.toLocaleString and not depend on the number format classes
  in the Closure library.
- Most of closure/goog/string/string.js was deleted.  The only function
  left is goog.string.subs as it is needed by goog.asserts.
