// initializes an API in the main frame (this frame). The contextMenus API
// requires JS initialization, which requires a JSRunner be instantiated for
// the context. If the new context (which is uninitialized and has no JSRunner)
// is used, this will fail. Instead, it should execute in this frame's context.
// See https://crbug.com/819968 for more details.
// IMPORTANT: For this test to be valid, the API being initialized (here,
// contextMenus), must have custom JS bindings.
