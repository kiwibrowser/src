/**
 * This extension provides two file browser handlers: 'ReadOnly' and
 * 'ReadWrite'. 'ReadOnly' handler handles .xul files and has read-only file
 * access. 'ReadWrite' handler handles .tiff files and has read-write file
 * access. The extension does not have persistent background page.
 *
 * The extension waits until 'ReadWrite' handler is executed and then runs tests
 * for it. The tests verify that the extension is able to read and write the
 * handled file. If there is an error before the tests are run,
 * chrome.test.notifyFail will be called, and further onExecute events will be
 * ignored.
 *
 * 'ReadOnly' handler is ignored by this test extension, but it must be defined
 * to conform to the expectations of file_browser/handler_test_runner
 *
 * The handlers are executed by 'file_browser/handler_test_runner' extension.
 * 'ReadWrite' handler are executed once, and should carry exactly one  handled
 * file.
