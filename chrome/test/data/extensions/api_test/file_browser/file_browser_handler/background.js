/**
 * This extension provides two file browser handlers: 'ReadOnly' and
 * 'ReadWrite'. 'ReadOnly' handler handles .xul files and has read-only file
 * access. 'ReadWrite' handler handles .tiff files and has read-write file
 * access.
 *
 * The extension waits until both handlers are executed and then runs tests for
 * them. The tests verify that the extension is able to read/write the handled
 * files as defined by the handlers' file access permissions. If there is an
 * error before the tests are run, chrome.test.notifyFail will be called, and
 * further onExecute events will be ignored.
 *
 * The handlers are executed by 'file_browser/handler_test_runner' extension.
 * Each of 'ReadOnly' and 'ReadWrite' handlers should be executed once, and each
 * should carry exactly one handled file.
