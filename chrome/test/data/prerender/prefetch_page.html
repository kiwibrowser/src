A page that fetches only "prefetch.js" when scanned by NoStatePrefetch, and
fetches "prefetch2.js" in addition to that if javascript execution is preformed
on the page. In all cases the scripts are executed in a blocking manner.

By prefetching this page a browsertest can verify that javascript was not
executed (prefetch2.js should not be requested to load even after the page has
been fully prefetched (or loaded)).

Note: there is no way to ensure that the script loaded via .appendChild() or a
sync XHR happens before a preload-scannable request because preload scanner is
racy and often fetches resources it sees before the inline script has a chance
to execute.
