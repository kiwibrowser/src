Security Critical: no

License File: NOT_SHIPPED

Description:
A simple script from Google Code support for automating uploads.

Local modifications:
-Added comment describing license. They have a comment about the license, but
it uses an atypical format that isn't recognized by chromium's checklicense
script.
-Instead of using the default netrc lookup which requires HOME to be set
(which normally isn't on Windows), specify the file using os.path.expanduser.
-Fail instead of prompting for username/password if none is given.
