// This class inspects the user's installed applications and builds a mapping of
// files to its associated application.
//
// Installed applications are found by searching the
// "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall" registry key and
// its variants. There are 2 cases that are covered:
//
// 1 - If the application's installer did its due dilligence, it populated the
//     "InstallLocation" registry key with the directory where it was installed,
//     and all the files under that directory are assumed to be owned by this
//     application.
//
//     In the event of 2 conflicting "InstallLocation", both are ignored as this
//     method doesn't let us know for sure who is the owner of any enclosing
//     files.
//
// 2 - If the application's entry is a valid MSI Product GUID, the complete list
// of
//     associated file is used to exactly match a given file to a application.
//
//     If multiple products installed the same file as the same component,
//     Windows keeps a reference count of that component so that the file
//     doesn't get removed if one of them is uninstalled. So both applications
//     are returned by GetInstalledApplications().
//
//  Note: Applications may be skipped and so would not be returned by
//        GetInstalledApplications() for the following reasons:
//        - The application is owned by Microsoft.
//        - The uninstall entry is marked as a system component.
//        - The uninstall entry has no display name.
//        - The uninstall entry has no UninstallString.
//
