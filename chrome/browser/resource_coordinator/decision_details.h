//
// A decision can contain multiple reasons for success or failure, and policy
// allows some success reasons to override some failure reasons and vice versa.
// The first reason posted to this object determines whether or not the overall
// outcome is positive or negative. It is assumed that reasons are posted in
// order of decreasing priority.
//
// For logging and inspection it is useful to know of all possible failure
// reasons blocking a success. Similarly, it is interesting to know of all of
// the possible success reasons blocking a failure. To this end, policy logic
// should continue populating the decision with details until is has "toggled".
// That is, a success reason has followed a chain of failures or vice versa.
// The "toggling" of the decision chain is indicated by the return value from
// AddReason. This allows writing code like the following:
//
// bool DecideIfCanDoSomething(DecisionDetails* details) {
//   if (some_condition_is_false) {
//     if (details->AddReason(kSomeFailureReason))
//       return details->IsPositive();
//   }
//   if (some_other_condition) {
//     if (details->AddReason(kSomeOtherFailureReason))
//       return details->IsPositive();
//   }
//   ...
