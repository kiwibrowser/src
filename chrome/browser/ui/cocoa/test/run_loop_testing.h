//
//    [someObj performSelector:@selector(someSel:) withObject:nil afterDelay:0];
//
// This is used when performing the work will negatively affect something
// currently on the stack. Unfortunately this also affects the testability of
// objects that do this. A call to this function will pump work like this from
// the event queue and run it until all such work, as of the time of calling
// this, has been processed.
//
// Note that this is not a NSApplication-based loop, and so things like NSEvents
// are *not* pumped from the event queue.
