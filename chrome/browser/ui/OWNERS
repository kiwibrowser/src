# NOTE: Do not use the above owners when you're in a subdirectory that has
# OWNERS file. Prefer these instead as these OWNERS will be more familiar, and
# to load balance. Only use the above for subdirectories when doing refactorings
# that touch all the platforms.

# This is for the common case of adding or renaming files. If you're doing
# structural changes, use usual OWNERS rules.
