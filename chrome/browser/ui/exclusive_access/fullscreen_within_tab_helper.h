// is in fullscreen mode, but the browser window is not. See

// level rather than at the Browser level. This allows tabs to be
// dragged/dropped between Browsers and have their fullscreen state handed off
// between FullscreenControllers as well.
//
// FullscreenWithinTabHelper is created on-demand, and its lifecycle is tied to
// that of its associated WebContents. It is automatically destroyed.
