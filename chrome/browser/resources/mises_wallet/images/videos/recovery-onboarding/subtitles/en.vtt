00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.580
MetaMask is a new way to connect
to sites and applications.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.860
On traditional websites, a central database
or bank is responsible for controlling and

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.179
recovering your accounts.

4
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.050
But on MetaMask, all of the power belongs
to the holder of a master key.

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.460
Whoever holds the key, controls the accounts.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.110
Your secret recovery phrase
is your "master key".

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.070
It's a series of 12 words that are generated
when you first set up MetaMask, which allow

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.120
you to recover your wallet and funds if you
ever lose access.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.451
It's important that you secure
your wallet by keeping your

10
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:37.510
secret recovery phrase
very safe, and very secret.

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.429
If anyone gets access to it, they will have
the "master key" to your wallet and can

12
00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.190
freely access and take all of your funds.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.109
To secure your MetaMask wallet you'll want
to safely save your secret recovery phrase.

14
00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.930
You can write it down, hide it somewhere,
put it in a safe deposit box

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.729
or use a secure password manager.

16
00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.050
Some users even engrave their
phrase onto a metal plate!

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.440
Nobody, not even the team
at MetaMask, can help you

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.820
recover your wallet if you lose
your secret recovery phrase.

19
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.072
If you haven't written down your secret recovery
phrase and stored it somewhere safe,

20
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.492
do it now. We'll wait.

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.780
And remember, never share your secret recovery
phrase with anyone: not even us.

22
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.910
If anyone ever asks you for it,
they're trying to scam you.

23
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.250
That's it!

24
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.020
Now you know what a secret recovery phrase
is and how to keep your wallet safe and secure.
