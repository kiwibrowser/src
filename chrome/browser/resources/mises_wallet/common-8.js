Canonical Transaction Chain (CTC) contract is an append-only log of transactions which must be applied to the rollup state. It defines the ordering of rollup transactions by writing them to the \'CTC:batches\' instance of the Chain Storage Container. The CTC also allows any account to \'enqueue\' an L2 transaction, which will require that the Sequencer will eventually append it to the rollup state. If the Sequencer does not include an enqueued transaction within the \'force inclusion period\', then any account may force it to be included by calling appendQueueBatch().
