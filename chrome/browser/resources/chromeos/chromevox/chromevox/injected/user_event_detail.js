/**
 * @fileoverview The ChromeVox User Event Detail object.
 *
 * This is the detail object for a CustomEvent that ChromeVox sends to the
 * current node in the DOM when the user wants to perform a ChromeVox action
 * that could potentially be handled better by the underlying web app.
 *
 * ChromeVox events are sent with status "PENDING" and an action that maps to
 * the command list in ChromeVoxUserCommands.
 *
 * If a web app wishes to handle the action, it can perform the action then set
 * the status of the event to either "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE".
 *
 * When the event bubbles back up to the document, ChromeVox will process it.
 * If the status is "PENDING", ChromeVox will perform the action itself.
 * If the status is "FAILURE", ChromeVox will speak the associated error message
 * for that action. (For example: "No next heading.")
 * If the status is "SUCCESS", then ChromeVox will check to see if an associated
 * resultNode is added to the event. If this node exists, then ChromeVox will
 * treat this node as the result of the action and sync/speak it as if it had
 * gotten to this node through ChromeVox's default algorithm. If this field is
 * left as null, then ChromeVox assumes that the web app has already handled
 * speaking/syncing to the result and will do nothing more for this action.
 *

 * will sync to this node and speak it.
