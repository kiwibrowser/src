/**
 * @fileoverview An interface (and partial implementation) for the basic
 * traversal through some piece of the dom.
 * For each different ordered (either in dom or by any other metric) set
 * of "valid selections" (just set from now on), a new
 * base class should be defined that implements this interface. For example,
 * there are subclasses for words, sentences, and lowest-level dom nodes.
 * These classes should all be stateless; this makes testing much more
 * effective at pinpointing errors.
 * For all of the operations in this interface, the position in the dom on
 * which to operate is given by a CursorSelection, see that file for
 * documentation.
 * The two main operations that currently exist for walkers are sync and
 * next. See the docs where those functions are defined.
 * Since most operations are hard to even define if there is no root element,
 * all operations may assume that the selection given is attached to the body
 * node. The behavior is undefined if any part of the selection passed in
 * is not attached to the body. As a user of this class, it is your
 * responsibility to make sure the selection is attached.
 * No operation may visibly modify any of its arguments. In particular, take
 * care with CursorSelections, since setReversed modifies the selection.
 * For all documentation, = refers to the method equals for CursorSelections
 * comparison.
 * Thinking of adding something in this class? Here are some good questions to
 * ask:
 * Is this an operation that applies to any element of any arbitrary set?
 * If not, then it probably doesn't belong here.
 * Does it need to know something other than the set that it operates on?
 * If so, then it probably doesn't belong here.
 *
 * This interface resembles a C++ STL bidirectional iterator. Additions should
 * keep this in mind.
 *

 * This takes a valid CursorSelection and returns the directed-next

 * following the selection passed in. If sel is at the "end" of a section,
 * this method may return null. In the example above, if we try to next on

 * Note that sel must be a valid selection. Undefined behavior if it isn't.

 * not be explicit tests for these, but subclasses are responsible for ensuring
 * them and callers may assume them:
 * 1) next(next(sel).setReversed(!sel.isReversed())) = sel for all sel if sel
 *    is a valid CursorSelection and next(sel) != null.
 *  That is, the valid elements for this walker are totally ordered; going
 *  forward and then backward returns us to the same cell.
 * 2) next(sel).isReversed() = sel.isReversed() for all sel if sel is a
 *    valid CursorSelection and next(sel) != null.

 * @param {!cvox.CursorSelection} sel The valid selection to start moving from.

 * This takes an arbitrary CursorSelection and returns a valid CursorSelection,

 * text nodes, and the selection passed in is for a single character within a
 * larger text node, this method should return a text node. No restrictions
 * are made as to exactly what selection should be returned, but it should be
 * something "reasonable", and from the user's point of view, "close" to the
 * previous selection. If no such selection exists, null may be returned.
 * Note that, since CursorSelection has a direction, syncing to a selection
 * should make sense in either direction.
 * Note also that, as mentioned in the file overview, this operation has
 * undefined behavior if the input selection is not attached to the body.
 * There are several invariants that must hold for any subclasses. While they
 * may not all be tested for at the time, subclasses are responsible for
 * making sure these hold, and any caller may assume these to be true:
 * 1) sync(sel) = sel iff sel is a valid selection
 *    This defines the set of valid selections for this walker.
 *    Note, in particular, that this implies sync(sync(sel)) = sync(sel)
 *    whenever sync(sel) != null.
 * 2) sync(sel).isReversed() = sel.isReversed() for all sel if sync(sel) != null
 *    That is, sync preserves direction.
 * Why do these restrictions exist? Because it makes it much easier to reason
 * about the effect (and intent) of an operation if we can make these
 * assumptions.
 * @param {!cvox.CursorSelection} sel The (possibly unsynched) selection.
