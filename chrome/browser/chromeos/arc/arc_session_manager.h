  // NOT_INITIALIZED: represents the state that the Profile is not yet ready
  //   so that this service is not yet initialized, or Chrome is being shut
  //   down so that this is destroyed.
  // STOPPED: ARC session is not running, or being terminated.
  // NEGOTIATING_TERMS_OF_SERVICE: Negotiating Google Play Store "Terms of
  //   Service" with a user. There are several ways for the negotiation,
  //   including opt-in flow, which shows "Terms of Service" page on ARC
  //   support app, and OOBE flow, which shows "Terms of Service" page as a
  //   part of Chrome OOBE flow.
  //   If user does not accept the Terms of Service, disables Google Play
  //   Store, which triggers RequestDisable() and the state will be set to
  //   STOPPED, then.
  // CHECKING_ANDROID_MANAGEMENT: Checking Android management status. Note that
  //   the status is checked for each ARC session starting, but this is the
  //   state only for the first boot case (= opt-in case). The second time and
  //   later the management check is running in parallel with ARC session
  //   starting, and in such a case, State is ACTIVE, instead.
  // REMOVING_DATA_DIR: When ARC is disabled, the data directory is removed.
  //   While removing is processed, ARC cannot be started. This is the state.
  // ACTIVE: ARC is running.
  // STOPPING: ARC is being shut down.
  //
  // State transition should be as follows:
  //
  // NOT_INITIALIZED -> STOPPED: when the primary Profile gets ready.
  // ...(any)... -> NOT_INITIALIZED: when the Chrome is being shutdown.
  // ...(any)... -> STOPPED: on error.
  //
  // In the first boot case:
  //   STOPPED -> NEGOTIATING_TERMS_OF_SERVICE: On request to enable.
  //   NEGOTIATING_TERMS_OF_SERVICE -> CHECKING_ANDROID_MANAGEMENT: when a user
  //     accepts "Terms Of Service"
  //   CHECKING_ANDROID_MANAGEMENT -> ACTIVE: when the auth token is
  //     successfully fetched.
  //
  // In the second (or later) boot case:
  //   STOPPED -> ACTIVE: when arc.enabled preference is checked that it is
  //     true. Practically, this is when the primary Profile gets ready.
  //
  // In the disabling case:
  //   NEGOTIATING_TERMS_OF_SERVICE -> STOPPED
  //   CHECKING_ANDROID_MANAGEMENT -> STOPPED
  //   ACTIVE -> STOPPING -> (maybe REMOVING_DATA_DIR ->) STOPPED
  //   STOPPING: Eventually change the state to STOPPED. Do nothing
  //     immediately.
  //   REMOVING_DATA_DIR: Eventually state will become STOPPED. Do nothing
  //     immediately.
