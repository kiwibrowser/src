# from a former on-disk version of a plist file instead of reading the current
# version from disk. The old behavior can be restored by setting the
# __CFPREFERENCES_AVOID_DAEMON environment variable, although extreme care
# should be used because portions of the system that use this API family
# normally and thus use cfprefsd and its cache will become unsynchronized with
# the on-disk state.
#
# This function is provided to set __CFPREFERENCES_AVOID_DAEMON when calling
# "defaults read" and thus avoid cfprefsd and its on-disk cache, and is
# intended only to be used to read values from Info.plist files, which are not
# preferences. The use of "defaults" for this purpose has always been
# questionable, but there's no better option to interact with plists from
# shell scripts. Definitely don't use infoplist_read to read preference
# plists.
#
# This function exists because the update process delivers new copies of
# Info.plist files to the disk behind cfprefsd's back, and if cfprefsd becomes
# aware of the original version of the file for any reason (such as this
# script reading values from it via "defaults read"), the new version of the

  # Try to clean up old versions that are not in use.  The strategy is to keep
  # the versioned directory corresponding to the update just applied
  # (obviously) and the version that was just replaced, and to use ps and lsof
  # to see if it looks like any processes are currently using any other old
  # directories.  Directories not in use are removed.  Old versioned
  # directories that are in use are left alone so as to not interfere with
  # running processes.  These directories can be cleaned up by this script on
  # future updates.
  #
  # To determine which directories are in use, both ps and lsof are used.
  # Each approach has limitations.
  #
  # The ps check looks for processes within the versioned directory.  Only
  # helper processes, such as renderers, are within the versioned directory.
  # Browser processes are not, so the ps check will not find them, and will
  # assume that a versioned directory is not in use if a browser is open
  # without any windows.  The ps mechanism can also only detect processes
  # running on the system that is performing the update.  If network shares
  # are involved, all bets are off.
  #
  # The lsof check looks to see what processes have the framework dylib open.
  # Browser processes will have their versioned framework dylib open, so this
  # check is able to catch browsers even if there are no associated helper
  # processes.  Like the ps check, the lsof check is limited to processes on
  # the system that is performing the update.  Finally, unless running as
  # root, the lsof check can only find processes running as the effective user
  # performing the update.
  #
  # These limitations are motivations to additionally preserve the versioned
  # directory corresponding to the version that was just replaced.
