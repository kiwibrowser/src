# usage: dmgdiffer.sh product_name old_dmg new_dmg patch_dmg
#
# dmgdiffer creates a disk image containing a binary update able to patch
# a product originally distributed in old_dmg to the version in new_dmg. Much
# of this script is generic, but the make_patch_fs function is specific to
# a product: in this case, Google Chrome.
#
# This script operates by mounting old_dmg and new_dmg, creating a new
# filesystem structure containing dirpatches generated by dirdiffer and
# goobsdiff (which should be located in the same directory as this script),
# and producing a disk image from that structure.
#
# The Chrome make_patch_fs function produces an disk image that is able to
# update a single old version on any Keystone channel to a new version on a
# specific Keystone channel (the Keystone channel associated with new_dmg).
# Chrome's updates are split into two dirpatches: one updates the old
# versioned directory to the new one, and the other updates the remainder of
# the application. The versioned directory is split out from the rest because
# it contains the bulk of the application and its name changes from version to
# version, and dirdiffer/dirpatcher do not directly handle name changes. This
# approach also allows the versioned directory dirpatch to be applied in-place
# in most cases during an update, rather than relying on a temporary
# directory. In order to allow a single update dmg to apply to an old version
# on any Keystone channel, several small files are never distributed as diffs,
# and only as full (possibly compressed) versions of the new files. These
# files include the outer application's Info.plist which contains Keystone
# channel information, and anything created or modified by code-signing the
# outer application.
#
# Application of update disk images produced by this script is
# product-specific. With updates managed by Keystone, the update disk images
# can contain a .keystone_install script that is able to locate and update
# the installed product.
#
# Exit codes:
#  0  OK
#  1  Unknown failure
#  2  Incorrect number of parameters
#  3  Input disk images do not exist
#  4  Output disk image already exists
#  5  Parent of output directory does not exist or is not a directory
