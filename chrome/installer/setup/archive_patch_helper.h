// A helper class that facilitates uncompressing and patching the chrome archive
// and installer.
//
// Chrome's installer is deployed along with a compressed archive containing
// either 1) an uncompressd archive of the product binaries or 2) a patch file
// to be applied to the uncompressed archive of the version being updated. To
// obtain the uncompressed archive, the contents of the compressed archive are
// uncompressed and extracted. Installation proceeds directly if the
// uncompressed archive is found after this step. Otherwise, the patch is
// applied to the previous version's uncompressed archive using either
// Courgette's ensemble patching or bspatch.
//
// Chrome's installer itself may also be deployed as a patch against the
// previous version's saved installer binary. The same process is followed to
// obtain the new installer. The compressed archive unconditionally contains a
// patch file in this case.
