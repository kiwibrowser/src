// more obvious methods for various reasons:
// - RegCopyTree isn't supported pre-Vista, so we'd have to do something
//   different for XP anyway.
// - SHCopyKey can't copy subkeys into a volatile destination, so we'd have to
//   worry about polluting the registry.
// We don't persist security attributes since we only delete keys that we own,
// and we don't set custom attributes on them anyway.
