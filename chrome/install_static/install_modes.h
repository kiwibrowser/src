// This file declares constants that describe specifics of a Chromium-based
// browser's branding and modes of installation.
//
// A browser's brand comprises all identifying markings that distinguish it from
// a browser produced by another party. Chromium has remnants of both the
// Chromium and Google Chrome brands.
//
// Each brand defines one primary install mode for the browser. A brand may
// additionally define one or more secondary install modes (e.g., Google
// Chrome's SxS mode for the canary channel). Install modes are described by
// compile-time instantiations of the `InstallConstants` struct in a brand's
// `kInstallModes` array. Index 0 of this array always describes the primary
// install mode. All other entries describe secondary modes, which are
// distinguished by an install suffix (e.g., " SxS") that appears in file and
// registry paths. A given machine may have any combination of a brand's modes
// installed at the same time (e.g., primary only, one or more secondary, or
// even primary and all secondary modes). Parallel installs of a brand's modes
// (e.g., Google Chrome and Google Chrome SxS (canary) installed on the same
// machine) store user data in distinct directories. Administrative policies, on
// the other hand, apply to all of a brand's install modes (e.g., the
// AlwaysOpenPdfExternally group policy setting applies to both Google Chrome
// and Google Chrome SxS.
