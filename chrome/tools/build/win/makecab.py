"""usage: makecab.py [options] source [destination]
Makes cab archives of single files, using zip compression.
Acts like Microsoft makecab.exe would act if passed `/D CompressionType=MSZIP`.
If [destination] is omitted, uses source with last character replaced with _.

options:
-h, --help: print this message
/D arg: silently ignored (for compat with makecab.exe)
/L outdir: put output file in outdir
/Vn: silently ignored (for compat with makecab.exe)
"""

# A cross-platform reimplementation of the bits of makecab.exe that we use.
# cab also supports LZX compression, which has a bitstream that allows for
# a higher compression rate than zip compression (aka deflate).  But the cab
# shipped to users is built on the signing server using regular Microsoft
# makecab.exe, so having something in-tree that is good enough is good enough.
