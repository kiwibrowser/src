# This is a buildbot configuration file containing a tagged list of files
# processed by the stage/archive scripts. The known tags are:
#
# filename: Name of the file in the build output directory.
# arch:     List of CPU architectures for which this file should be processed
#           (values are based on the strings returned by python's
#           platform.architecture() function).  Leave unspecified for
#           architecture neutral files.
# buildtype: List of build types for which this file should be processed.
# archive: The name of the archive file to store filename in. If not specified,
#          filename is added to the default archive (e.g. platform.zip). If
#          archive == filename, filename is archived directly, not zipped.
# direct_archive: Force a file to be archived as-is, bypassing zip creation.
#                 NOTE: This flag will not apply if more than one file has the
#                 same 'archive' name, which will create a zip of all the
#                 files instead.
# filegroup: List of named groups to which this file belongs (e.g. 'symbols'
#            for symbol processing, 'tests' for running tests, etc.).
# optional: List of buildtypes for which the file might not exist, and it's not
#           considered an error.
