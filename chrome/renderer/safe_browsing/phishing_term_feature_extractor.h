// PhishingTermFeatureExtractor handles computing term features from the text
// of a web page for the client-side phishing detection model.  To do this, it
// takes a list of terms that appear in the model, and scans through the page
// text looking for them.  Any terms that appear will cause a corresponding
// features::kPageTerm feature to be added to the FeatureMap.
//
// To make it harder for a phisher to enumerate all of the relevant terms in
// the model, the terms are provided as SHA-256 hashes, rather than plain text.
//
// There is one PhishingTermFeatureExtractor per RenderView.
