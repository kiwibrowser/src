<h1 id="icons">Manifest - Icons</h1>

<p>
One or more icons that represent the extension, app, or theme.
You should always provide a 128x128 icon;
it's used during installation and by the Chrome Web Store.
Extensions should also provide a 48x48 icon,
which is used in the extensions management page
(chrome://extensions).
You can also specify a 16x16 icon to be used as the favicon
for an extension's pages.

<p>
Icons should generally be in PNG format,
because PNG has the best support for transparency.
They can, however, be in any format supported by WebKit,
including BMP, GIF, ICO, and JPEG.
Here's an example of specifying the icons:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"icons": { "16": "icon16.png",
           "48": "icon48.png",
          "128": "icon128.png" },
</pre>

<p class="note">
You may provide icons of any other size you wish, and Chrome will attempt to use
the best size where appropriate. For example, Windows often requires 32-pixel
icons, and if the app includes a 32-pixel icon, Chrome will choose that instead
of shrinking a 48-pixel icon down. However, you should ensure that all of your
icons are square, or unexpected behavior may result.
</p>

<p>
If you upload your extension, app, or theme using the
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">Chrome Developer Dashboard</a>,
you'll need to upload additional images,
including at least one screenshot of your extension.

developer documentation</a>.
