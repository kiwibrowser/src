<h1>Message Passing</h1>


<p>
Since content scripts run in the context of a web page and not the extension,
they often need some way of communicating with the rest of the extension. For
example, an RSS reader extension might use content scripts to detect the
presence of an RSS feed on a page, then notify the background page in order to
display a page action icon for that page.

<p>
Communication between extensions and their content scripts works by using
message passing. Either side can listen for messages sent from the other end,
and respond on the same channel. A message can contain any valid JSON object
(null, boolean, number, string, array, or object). There is a simple API for
<a href="#simple">one-time requests</a>
and a more complex API that allows you to have
<a href="#connect">long-lived connections</a>
for exchanging multiple messages with a shared context. It is also possible to
send a message to another extension if you know its ID, which is covered in
the
<a href="#external">cross-extension messages</a>
section.


<h2 id="simple">Simple one-time requests</h2>
<p>
If you only need to send a single message to another part of your extension
(and optionally get a response back), you should use the simplified
$(ref:runtime.sendMessage)
{{^is_apps}}
or $(ref:tabs.sendMessage)
{{/is_apps}}.
This lets you send a one-time JSON-serializable message from a
content script to extension
{{^is_apps}}
, or vice versa, respectively
{{/is_apps}}.
An optional callback parameter allows you handle the response from the other
side, if there is one.

<p>
Sending a request from a content script looks like this:
<pre data-filename="contentscript.js">
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({greeting: "hello"}, function(response) {
  console.log(response.farewell);
});
</pre>

<p>
Sending a request from the extension to a content script looks very similar,
except that you need to specify which tab to send it to. This example
demonstrates sending a message to the content script in the selected tab.
<pre data-filename="background.html">
chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
  chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, {greeting: "hello"}, function(response) {
    console.log(response.farewell);
  });
});
</pre>

<p>
On the receiving end, you need to set up an
$(ref:runtime.onMessage)
event listener to handle the message. This looks the same from a content
script or extension page.
<pre>
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(
  function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
    console.log(sender.tab ?
                "from a content script:" + sender.tab.url :
                "from the extension");
    if (request.greeting == "hello")
      sendResponse({farewell: "goodbye"});
  });
</pre>

In the above example, <code>sendResponse</code> was called synchronously.
If you want to asynchronously use <code>sendResponse</code>, add
<code>return true;</code> to the <code>onMessage</code> event handler.

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> If multiple pages are listening for onMessage events, only the
first to call sendResponse() for a particular event will succeed in sending the
response. All other responses to that event will be ignored.

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> The <code>sendResponse</code> callback is only valid if used
synchronously, or if the event handler returns <code>true</code> to indicate
that it will respond asynchronously. The <code>sendMessage</code> function's
callback will be invoked automatically if no handlers return true or if the
<code>sendResponse</code> callback is garbage-collected.


<h2 id="connect">Long-lived connections</h2>
<p>
Sometimes it's useful to have a conversation that lasts longer than a single
request and response. In this case, you can open a long-lived channel from
your content script to an extension page
{{^is_apps}}
, or vice versa,
{{/is_apps}}
using $(ref:runtime.connect)
{{^is_apps}}
or $(ref:tabs.connect), respectively
{{/is_apps}}.
The channel can optionally have a name, allowing you to distinguish between
different types of connections.

<p>
One use case might be an automatic form fill extension. The content script
could open a channel to the extension page for a particular login, and send a
message to the extension for each input element on the page to request the
form data to fill in. The shared connection allows the extension to keep
shared state linking the several messages coming from the content script.

<p>
When establishing a connection, each end is given a
$(ref:runtime.Port)
object which is used for sending and receiving messages through that
connection.

<p>
Here is how you open a channel from a content script, and send and listen for
messages:
<pre data-filename="contentscript.js">
var port = chrome.runtime.connect({name: "knockknock"});
port.postMessage({joke: "Knock knock"});
port.onMessage.addListener(function(msg) {
  if (msg.question == "Who's there?")
    port.postMessage({answer: "Madame"});
  else if (msg.question == "Madame who?")
    port.postMessage({answer: "Madame... Bovary"});
});
</pre>

{{^is_apps}}
<p>
Sending a request from the extension to a content script looks very similar,
except that you need to specify which tab to connect to. Simply replace the
call to connect in the above example with $(ref:tabs.connect).
{{/is_apps}}

<p>
In order to handle incoming connections, you need to set up a
$(ref:runtime.onConnect)
event listener. This looks the same from a content script or an extension
page. When another part of your extension calls "connect()", this event is
fired, along with the
$(ref:runtime.Port)
object you can use to send and receive messages through the connection. Here's
what it looks like to respond to incoming connections:
<pre>
chrome.runtime.onConnect.addListener(function(port) {
  console.assert(port.name == "knockknock");
  port.onMessage.addListener(function(msg) {
    if (msg.joke == "Knock knock")
      port.postMessage({question: "Who's there?"});
    else if (msg.answer == "Madame")
      port.postMessage({question: "Madame who?"});
    else if (msg.answer == "Madame... Bovary")
      port.postMessage({question: "I don't get it."});
  });
});
</pre>

<h3 id="port-lifetime">Port lifetime</h3>
<p>
Ports are designed as a two-way communication method between different parts of
the extension, where a (top-level) frame is viewed as the smallest part.
<br>
Upon calling $(ref:tabs.connect), $(ref:runtime.connect) or
$(ref:runtime.connectNative), a $(ref:runtime.Port Port) is created.
This port can immediately be used for sending messages to the other end via
$(ref:runtime.Port.postMessage postMessage).

<p>
If there are multiple frames in a tab, calling $(ref:tabs.connect) results in
multiple invocations of the $(ref:runtime.onConnect) event
(once for each frame in the tab).
Similarly, if $(ref:runtime.connect) is used, then the onConnect event
may be fired multiple times (once for every frame in the extension process).

<p>
You may want to find out when a connection is closed, for example if you are
maintaining separate state for each open port. For this you can listen to the
$(ref:runtime.Port.onDisconnect)
event. This event is fired when there are no valid ports at the other side of
the channel. This happens in the following situations:
<ul>
  <li>
    There are no listeners for $(ref:runtime.onConnect) at the other end.
  <li>
    The tab containing the port is unloaded (e.g. if the tab is navigated).
  <li>
    The frame from where <code>connect</code> was called has unloaded.
  <li>
    All frames that received the port (via $(ref:runtime.onConnect)) have
    unloaded.
  <li>
    $(ref:runtime.Port.disconnect) is called by <em>the other end</em>.
    Note that if a <code>connect</code> call results in multiple ports at the
    receiver's end, and <code>disconnect()</code> is called on any of these
    ports, then the <code>onDisconnect</code> event is only fired at the port
    of the sender, and not at the other ports.
</ul>


<h2 id="external">Cross-extension messaging</h2>
<p>
In addition to sending messages between different components in your
extension, you can use the messaging API to communicate with other extensions.
This lets you expose a public API that other extensions can take advantage of.

<p>
Listening for incoming requests and connections is similar to the internal
case, except you use the
$(ref:runtime.onMessageExternal)
or
$(ref:runtime.onConnectExternal)
methods. Here's an example of each:
<pre>
// For simple requests:
chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(
  function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
    if (sender.id == blocklistedExtension)
      return;  // don't allow this extension access
    else if (request.getTargetData)
      sendResponse({targetData: targetData});
    else if (request.activateLasers) {
      var success = activateLasers();
      sendResponse({activateLasers: success});
    }
  });

// For long-lived connections:
chrome.runtime.onConnectExternal.addListener(function(port) {
  port.onMessage.addListener(function(msg) {
    // See other examples for sample onMessage handlers.
  });
});
</pre>

<p>
Likewise, sending a message to another extension is similar to sending one
within your extension. The only difference is that you must pass the ID of the
extension you want to communicate with. For example:
<pre>
// The ID of the extension we want to talk to.
var laserExtensionId = "abcdefghijklmnoabcdefhijklmnoabc";

// Make a simple request:
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(laserExtensionId, {getTargetData: true},
  function(response) {
    if (targetInRange(response.targetData))
      chrome.runtime.sendMessage(laserExtensionId, {activateLasers: true});
  });

// Start a long-running conversation:
var port = chrome.runtime.connect(laserExtensionId);
port.postMessage(...);
</pre>


<h2 id="external-webpage">Sending messages from web pages</h2>
<p>
Similar to <a href="#external">cross-extension messaging</a>,
your app or extension can receive and
respond to messages from regular web pages.
To use this feature, you must first
specify in your manifest.json which web sites you want to communicate with. For
example:

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"externally_connectable": {
  "matches": ["*://*.example.com/*"]
}
</pre>

<p>
This will expose the messaging API to any page which matches the URL patterns
you specify. The URL pattern must contain at least a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain">second-level domain</a>
- that is, hostname
patterns like "*", "*.com", "*.co.uk", and "*.appspot.com" are prohibited.
From the web page, use the
$(ref:runtime.sendMessage)
or
$(ref:runtime.connect)
APIs to send a message to a specific app or extension. For example:
<pre>
// The ID of the extension we want to talk to.
var editorExtensionId = "abcdefghijklmnoabcdefhijklmnoabc";

// Make a simple request:
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(editorExtensionId, {openUrlInEditor: url},
  function(response) {
    if (!response.success)
      handleError(url);
  });
</pre>

<p>
From your app or extension, you may listen to messages from web pages via the
$(ref:runtime.onMessageExternal)
or
$(ref:runtime.onConnectExternal)
APIs, similar to <a href="#external">cross-extension messaging</a>.
Only the web page can initiate a connection.
Here is an example:

<pre>
chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(
  function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
    if (sender.url == blocklistedWebsite)
      return;  // don't allow this web page access
    if (request.openUrlInEditor)
      openUrl(request.openUrlInEditor);
  });
</pre>

<h2 id="security-considerations">Security considerations</h2>

<p>
When receiving a message from a content script or another extension, your
background page should be careful not to fall victim to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site
scripting</a>.  Specifically, avoid using dangerous APIs such as the
below:
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {greeting: "hello"}, function(response) {
  // WARNING! Might be evaluating an evil script!
  var resp = eval("(" + response.farewell + ")");
});
</pre>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {greeting: "hello"}, function(response) {
  // WARNING! Might be injecting a malicious script!
  document.getElementById("resp").innerHTML = response.farewell;
});
</pre>
<p>
Instead, prefer safer APIs that do not run scripts:
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {greeting: "hello"}, function(response) {
  // JSON.parse does not evaluate the attacker's scripts.
  var resp = JSON.parse(response.farewell);
});
</pre>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {greeting: "hello"}, function(response) {
  // innerText does not let the attacker inject HTML elements.
  document.getElementById("resp").innerText = response.farewell;
});
</pre>
