// An interface for lightweight synchronization of object properties; it is
// generally intended to allow properties of UI-layer objects (typically view
// controllers) to be observed without the observer needing to know the identity
// of the observed object.
//
// ChromeBroadcaster is not intended to be able to be used for arbitrary
// property observation; rather there is a defined protocol (BroadcastObserver)
// of observer methods which are associated with broadcasting objects.
//
// (The class is named 'ChromeBroadcaster' to avoid various symbol conflicts
// that the terser name 'Broadcaster' creates, but associated classes and
// properties will refer to instances of this class as just a 'Broadcaster' for
// simplicity.)

// BroadcastObserver protocol, or if a value is already being broadcast
// for |selector|.

// methods called immediately with the current broadcast value, before this
// method returns.
