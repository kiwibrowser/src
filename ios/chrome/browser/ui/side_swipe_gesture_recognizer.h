// This gesture recognizer is used because the default swipe gesture recognizer
// is too restrictive.  The default swipe requires a particular velocity and
// distance that Chrome does not require.
// Another benefit of using a custom gesture recognizer is it can fail faster,
// so recognizers that depend on this recognizer can begin faster.
