// Determines whether the user is still engaged with the bubble view. Defaults
// to |YES|. After a certain duration of time, is set to |NO| automatically.
// Used to determine whether the bubble has influenced the user's
// action. For example, if a bubble appears pointing at the tab switcher button,
// and the user taps the tab switcher button shortly after, |userEngaged| would
// be |YES| because the user has recently seen the bubble and can reasonably be
// assumed to be influenced by it. However, if a bubble appears in the same
// scenario, but the user ignores it and doesn't click the tab switcher button
// until significantly later, |userEngaged| will be |NO| because it is unlikely
// the bubble had an effect on the user's action.

// Determines whether a follow-up action, such as highlighting a UI element,
// should be triggered. This depends on |userEngaged|, since a follow-up action
// should only occur if the user is engaged with the bubble. Defaults to |YES|,
// and is set to |NO| once |userEngaged| is set to |NO| or after the user has
// triggered the follow-up action.

// is the position of the arrow on the bubble. |dismissalCallback| is a block
// invoked when the bubble is dismissed (manual and automatic dismissal).
// |dismissalCallback| is optional.
