This will become a reusable extensions module. It implements the core parts of
Chrome's extension system, and can be used with any host of the
[content module](/content/README.md).

Some extensions code that is not Chrome-specific still lives in
[//chrome/browser/extensions](/chrome/browser/extensions) and will be moved
here.
